Hes okay but I find lecture to be mostly worthless. He makes it fun and half the class really enjoys it and jokes around with him the whole time. But he often puts up code that is pages long and expects you to know what its doing after 3 seconds when no one does. His tests are very hard. His last test (not the final) the average was 17/50.
Very unclear and expects you to know everything before you come to class. All what you do in class is "talk to each other".
Course mostly oriented to CS outsiders, not challenging for CS majors.
Lectures don't help too much on the lab assignments. TA help is a big deal for this course. Exams aren't bad as you can use a note sheet to help you get by
No rubrics for exams or homework. Often condescending toward students. Knowledgeable about parallel computing, but poor at explaining. Very hard to follow. Assumes knowledge well in advance of what's stated in syllabus/course description. Exams may be curved, and a practice exam is posted ahead of time, which is why this review is a 2 and not a 1.
Both the lectures and textbook aren't very good. The lectures feel unprepared and as a result, its tough to find the main points. A lot of people skipped lectures so I don't think I was the only one to find them useless. The assignments are pretty ambiguous but they expect specific answers. The projects are long but alright. Exams are rough.
He knows the knowledge very well. But NOT good at instructing others. Unable to find the keypoints and logic in his lecture.
George himself was o.k. although lecture usefulness is debatable. Class is excessively difficult for an undergrad class, and a very dismissive attitude is taken when students struggle with material or approach him with suggestions/complaints. He needs to do a better job of managing or selecting TAs: ours had an ego problem. Avoid if you can.
George is used to teaching grad level students. He is dismissive if a student has trouble understanding material and blames it on a lack of effort. His slight accent is easily understandable. You are graded on things that aren't asked of you in the assignments, so make sure you go above and beyond.
This professor teaches decently, is understandable, and is generally a nice person. However, The assignments are vague, resulting in low scores. He does not help when there are questions, claiming the assignment is clear. The tests are intentionally very difficult. He teaches different, more difficult, topics than others that teach this course.
Professor doesnt go in depth in lecture, but expects you to know high level java for completion of the homework assignments. The labs are once again just skimming the surface, and the homework (worth 40% of your grade), is very high level, and unorganized. Tests are OK, they are a good representation of the practice exams.
Seems like a smart guy, but not great teaching skills. I agree with most of the other posts. I found the class easy so I cannot say much about his helpfulness.
He mostly does not prepare and let things flow by moving from a side story to another and for who does not know what he is talking about, that might sound interesting. and I agree with the posts on his attitude.
Honestly the lectures just need to be improved a lot. 75 minutes of reading from slides is not a pleasant experience. The lectures should have better examples for the types of problems found on homework and exams.
If you do ALL the practice problems in the readings, spend time understanding the assigned homework and start your labs early enough, you will do above average. If you put in the time, the curve is on your side. Lecture is not necessary. Discussion steers you in the right direction for tests. Hard class but you'll excel if you have discipline.
Lectures- straight from the textbook and copied from other profs. Heavy accent, difficult to understand what he's saying. Don't really need to attend Labs- seem tough at first, really aren't that bad. Lots of help online Tests- average in the 50-60% range. Material unlike what's in class for some Could be worse, but not great
Lectures are straight from the textbook. Intentionally comes up with exam problems that have never been covered either in class or in the textbook. Avoid if possible. Seriously, what is the point of a test if it tests something that was never covered...
Mats begins every single lecture with, "Where were we last time?" This is a microcosm into his mind. He shoots from the hip in a way that made me a bit uncomfortable. Funny, but unfocused. Sometimes insulting when asking students to shout out answers. Very honest about the messiness and difficulty of computer science.
This guy is a stand-up comedian! Is a master of talking forever without really teaching anything!! His TAs have no clue what he's teaching in class, while he has no clue what his TAs are doing. Very lazy to respond to forum posts as well. Overall, a very boring Professor. Register for his class if you don't want any appreciable work load.
Poor lecturer. He sometimes fails to finish his lecture before time runs out, but those missing materials appear in exams. He give extra credits for attendance.
Class was meh. He's really not the best at explaining things, but you can sometimes make up for it by reading. His TAs really sucked my semester, so grading issues took forever to resolve. Probably the worst CSci class i've taken, but it's not impossible. Take it with another professor if possible.
Expect to learn primarily from the textbook with this class. Extra credit was given for attending lectures. The lectures were incredibly boring with professor He seeming unprepared at times. His accent can be incredibly difficult to understand. The TA's were mostly useless. Avoid this professor if you can.
God alone understand what he says and there is no relevance between his teaching and his HWs
Dr. Banerjee is knowledgeable about the subject and provides interesting lectures. However, there is no organization or detail in his notes. Tests are poorly-written and vary considerably in style. The assignments are time-consuming and don't help much with the tests. He isn't mean at all, but the course was a headache.
Lot of enthusiasm and passion for the subject. Very resourceful, answers any question, happy to help. Great guy, terrible teacher. Omits a lot of basic things, important definitions and thus the context is lost sometimes. Uses the board as scribble pad with no order. Switches b/n notations. Huge HWs. Overall, the course is a pain but rewarding.
(Note: Baylor left UMN after 2014.) Baylor does care about your learning, which you can see in the fact that he devotes far more time to helping students outside of class than any other professor. But that doesn't make up for the fact that his lectures and general course organization are completely inept. He does give easy A's, though.
Baylor is likable, and also incredibly responsive to e-mail and forum queries. But this class was a hot mess. Lectures were more like riffs than lessons. The textbook was literally never mentioned. We fell so far behind that both a major assignment and an exam were canceled. Baylor is your best shot an at easy A, but you may also learn a lot less.
Main focus is for you to learn the material. The assignments he gives are either way to hard and time consuming or too easy.
You'll see lots of praise for Baylor due to his constant talk of video games, but I'm on the other side. The class was disorganised up the very last day -- weights for tests/homework were unknown, entire projects cancelled. A 3-hour homework was given the same weight as the final project (40 hrs +)! He was a nice guy, but did not plan well at all.
I regret so much for taking AI with him. He made the class a Game programming class rather than starting with AI basics as it was supposed to be. Funny guy but way to fast. Grading was easy but his assignments are hopeless and silly. Nothing concrete. HWs are boring and weird. Not a good instructor. A lot of writing in his class. he is real funny.
Actual content isn't very hard, especially if you have some CSCI knowledge. Unfortunately, Jensen likes to test on things he has said rather than ideas, so you should attend. Homeworks were OK but chronically underspecified - ask the Grad TAs or pay the price. Overall, not a terrible class but Jensen is a jerk.
The overall course goals seemed useful but a huge part of your grade relies on assignments that you can't ask any questions about. The grading criteria/instructions for these were vague at best. The quizzes will go well if you do the exercises which were not as hard and you could ask questions about.
Lecture for this class was not very helpful... The most important part was just doing the readings and exercises. He does not post lecture notes online/have them electronically at all. Also, my biggest complaint is sometimes in class when students asked questions he'd be really mean when he answered (pretentious). The weekly quizzes can be hard
This class is very difficult to pass if you have little to know experience with coding. Some people in this class are not even majoring in computer science but he makes the class very hard and we are expected to be perfect. Jensen does not believe in a curved class. This explains why 30% of the class used their W to withdraw from it.
I cried every day because of this class. The homework is insanely hard and was not rewarding for me. You need to pay attention in class, sit in the front because he favors the people in the front. I hated his teaching style, he was very condescending "this is easy" "it couldn't be simpler" got old real fast. If you don't get it, you never will.
I'm going to have to dissent here: I think that Professor Jensen is condescending at best. His lecture style is reminiscent of a high school teacher. He may be OK if you are a freshman, but as an older student I found his lectures slow and fairly light on content. On a positive note, his review sheets for tests are accurate: study that and ace it.
He's a pretty good professor, and his lectures are clear, which made the labs valuable. However, be aware that when he says he doesn't curve, he doesn't curve. I got 93.96 in his class, and because 94 is an A, I got an A-. He could have been clearer on the homework assignments, to warn us about possible mistakes we couldn't have known about.
Lectures are pretty much useless, but he is there is help if you go to office hours. Ended up skipping every class, still the easiest A out of any class I've taken so far. Tests are extremely straightforward, right from the textbook, and the class is extremely slow paced. Highly recommend.
The lectures are only on the theoretical part of graphics, while the homework is on actually programming with OpenGL, leaving the student to learn OpenGL on their own. Then then midterm is on the theory stuff that you learned once but never practiced on homework. Wanted to learn how to actually program with graphics - learned nothing from class.
Lectures are dry, from book slides, and very fast. Homework assignments are hard and sometimes not covered well in readings and lecture. Midterm are hard and heavily curved with averages about 30%. Lab assignments are difficult and come from the book. If you don't understand something Kyle will explain it to you well 1-on-1 or in office hours.
Awesome Professor, Though there is only 3 categories (Helpfulness, Clarity, and Easiness) He excels in many other categories such as being loose with test scores and assignments. He also assigns specific homework assignments that seem very personal, they are very easy but don't really help. The only bad thing is he doesn't prepare you for tests.
If you've taken a computer science class before, do not feel compelled to take 1133. While Haiyi explains everything fine, she has no gauge on lecture interest. Most of the class is messing around during lecture on a laptop and/or cell phone. Labs are not hard and have helpful TA's. Google forms are used for attendance and r only reason to show up.
you need to be a genius, else you wont be able to do anything in class. even if you ask him he will give you 4D chess advice which wont help you at all. but then if youre a genius you wont need to attend the class. all in all, dont take the class unless youre a genius or youre a retard that dont care bout your grades
I would strongly recommend AVOIDING taking a class with David Husom. He tends to ramble quite a bit, doesn't stick to the course material during lectures, and does a poor job at answering questions.
Took UC 3201 with David Husom and you really work for your grade. You have one quiz the entire semester and the bulk of your grade is basically based off the website you design. David gives you the "Textbook" (course notes) via Google Drive folder for free. You don't have to go to class if you follow the course notes every week and submit the work.
Class wasn't that hard but I also didn't get much out of it. He spent the first half of the semester introducing material and the second half summarizing without really getting deep into it. Be prepared to spend time learning the material on your own to the point where I would recommend self studying or taking a different course.
Not the best lecturer--he struggled to engage the class with the method he delivered content which was just pretty much reading off of slides. The projects, which make up most of the grade, were also not really related to the content being learned in class/tested on.
Homework takes at least 6hrs a week plus 2-3hours of reading. His lectures are bad. He seems very nice and knowledgeable, but I'm not sure why he teaches b/c he has a full time day job. Intro but definitely recommend taking another CSCI class first. The midterms are mostly writing instead of reading code which makes them a lot harder.
You never know what your grade is. He never puts anything in the grade book so I don't know what I got on my first paper 3 months ago. I hate how I don't know where I stand. He puts so much emphasis on participation even though it is only 10% of your grade, but the way he talks, I think he won't even follow the syllabus's grading scale.
The guy is boring most of the times,he doesn't explain well,above all he hires a bad TAs,really mean TAs,so watch out fro this guy,avoid if possible,but i know like my case he only teaches this course(Fortran 1107) once in a year-every fall
Had Prof. Barry for Discrete Math. He is not a good teacher for the class but I don't think it would have mattered for me. He has a really monotone voice and doesn't know what he is doing most of the time. But his tests were good.
He did not seem very prepared for lectures, and he would habitually over-explain things, When we had guest lecturers he would spend about 5 minutes asking a question that could have been 10 words.
Awful teacher of the material, most of what I learned was on my own through use of the textbook. Provided slides which was helpful but I rarely gained anything from listening to him speak. Makes lots of mistakes, can't hear you when you point it out.
Tough professor. Likely more interesting if you have actually had linear algebra before, as he really goes in to too much detail. Homeworks take forever and are not easy. Avoid if possible.
Homework is very time consuming! But the exam is completely the same as the HW. HW also has great weight. So if you do them well you'll be OK. He is smart but not a good teacher. Actually using slides and board together is the worst method of teaching. He write down things on the board disorderly.
Professor Saad does seem to be a smart guy, but his homework assignments and test are pretty hard. Expect a lot of hours of work.
He's a nice guy but a poor professor. He doesn't know much about operating systems beyond what the textbook provides, and as a result he would just respond to broader questions with "I'm not sure." I've taken both 4061 and 5103 with him and honestly he's singlehandedly destroyed my interest in OS. His explanations are way too unclear and confusing.
This professor is simply awesome and the only concern was that one has to do sometimes silly, useless, codes just for coding. Other than that, the class was OK and the professor was excellent.
I have never in my life had a professor who made me feel so incredibly incompetent. The class itself is super interesting and I absolutely loved the material, but I truly have nothing nice to say about Redish. Of my three one-on-one interactions with him, he made me feel stupid in each. Take this class if you want to fuel your impostor syndrome
There's no book to reference if you're confused by lectures. All his lectures seem to be promoting his lab or his colleagues. You don't learn any clear definitions. Biggest thing: he refuses to make adjustments for disabled students even when they have a documented accommodations letter.
He's a tough professor. He's smart and his class concepts are incredibly interesting, but he's a very a harsh grader, and you'll have to work hard. He's very accessible outside of class and loves to answer questions, so if you have trouble with concepts, go talk to him. Also read his book. I loved the material, just had to work really hard.
Redish is incredibly arrogant. For one the essays, the only feedback he gave was to highlight as "great" his OWN QUOTE! I second that you're toast if you miss what he says. There are short answer quizzes after every lecture that are harshly graded. In addition, his idea of clarifying what he means is to use computer science jargon.
Memorize the lectures and you'll pass. Provides very vague feedback on essays, homework and exams. I learned a lot but this has been the most stressful class in my academic career.
Would not recommend 4021 with Mark. Smart and nice guy, but the class structure is not great. 2 programming assignments, midterm and final. Start early on projects because if you need help asking at the end of class is the only way to get it. Midterm and final questions r specific to what he says in class so take notes to what he covers in class.
Your grade is only made up of 4 things: 2 labs, midterm, and final. He doen't give clear example for labs, and what he does tell you he explains very quickly. so if you miss something you're SOL. He also takes forever to respond to emails. So when you miss something you cant even ask for help. The final had questions he said wouldnt be on it
Prof. Schrater seemed pretty checked out this semester. It sounded like he had a lot of personal stuff going on, but I still paid for a certain amount of instruction that I didn't receive. Limited feedback, disorganized lectures, and not responsive to students outside of class. 5525 is a weird class anyway, Schrater didn't help.
Professor Schrater just didnt seem up to the task of teaching this class. He seemed unprepared and did not really care about this class at all. However, what made this class even worse were his TAs who were very rude and condescending and did not offer any help. I would avoid taking 5512 with him.
He was really good at the material and clearly knew what he was talking about. Easy to approach after class or in OH. Only reason he's getting a 2 is he would keep putting down the TA during lectures and it made my kinda uncomfortable since she was the only TA and when I talked to her in her OH she was definitely putting in the work.
Professor Schater is a very nice guy and cares a lot about both his students and the course. However, many parts of the course were explained as if I already had knowledge of everything in the course. Introductory Stats is required for the course and for good reason, but I still felt as if I were missing a few previous courses in this subject.
It was a very tough class, I had to drop it. His reasoning is very "jumpy".
Chandra himself gave clear lectures, albeit sometimes lacking detail. That being said, the administrative parts of this course were terrible, and there were a lot of issues with TA-related tasks like grading, project clarity, and labs starting late or not at all. Chandra ignored or complained when students brought up these issues. Do not recommend.
So here's the deal with Professor Chandra : He's super nice, tries to be as helpful as possible if you seek him out outside of class, and his lectures make sense. Sounds amazing, but his lectures are VERY concept heavy, so you can learn something in lecture, completely understand the concept, but then take a nosedive on projects and labs.(Part 1)
A nice guy but cannot teach. Exams are biased toward a few knowledge points that he never really focused on. He chose a worse TA(Kwangsung Oh) to make him looks not that bad, who gives docs 50 points but never read it. Programming part is 50 points and if your output format is not what TA wants, you will get the same score as those team can't run.
He moves so slowly through the material that it's harder to learn. Can learn most of the material through trial and error in the lab or through googling.
It is really difficult to concentrate in his class, it's quite boring. Most people just watch the lecture recordings later at their own time. The only good thong about the course is the projects which make you learn a great deal. Also the grading criteria is not very clear
Fairly straightforward lectures. Grading can be agonizingly slow, taking 6 weeks in some cases. Also, make sure you do NOT get help outside of class (Google, past students, etc.) or he will fail you on the spot.
Dr. Lu almost exclusively reads from the slides with few code examples. I was unengaged since day 1. The tests include large true/false and matching sections, so be prepared to memorize concepts in a field that is mostly application-driven. The projects are interesting though.
Professor is great, personable and explains concepts well, but this class is a joke. I felt like I learned very little although I did well. Everything came from the textbook, and lecture did not help at all. If you want a good grade, this is good. If you want to learn, then it's not worth it.
He is a nice person, but sometimes his lectures are kind of confusing. Did not do a great job on explaining the material clearly.
His lecture slides and the textbook (which he coauthored), was useless, it would give you the general concept, but wouldn't show you how to apply any of it. Useless, but at least he is a nice guy.
Sattar's lectures offer little content, notes are some of the most anemic and inconsistent I've seen. He borrows nearly every picture and homework problem from random online resources without citation. He wastes a lot of time flexing his trips and accolades. HWs are easy but unclear. Junaed cares about teaching, but his personality gets in the way.
Hes a great guy and a good teacher, but as a professor hes also responsible for the course structure and material. I found the class to be disorganized and frustrating. I think if this had been a more test-heavy class, I wouldve rated him much higher. I would only recommend taking this class with him after hes taught it a few more times.
Great dude, well-organized class but not a bad lecturer. He bit off more than the students and staff could chew for the course project. It was clearly too large and complicated for the class. If it wasn't for me getting put in a very good group I may not have passed the class, but I guess now that it's over I do feel I've learned a lot.
The good: He is smart and explains concepts well. The bad: Requires 95% for an A and 60% of the grade comes from tests. He refuses to curve the grades. Assuming 100% in all controllables (homework / labs) you would need 92% on midterm and final to reach the 95% overall. It is nearly impossible to get an A. No practice tests.
Moen uses his own grading scale, so it's easy to pass (60% for C-) but hard to succeed (95% for A). Grades this semester consisted of only 6 items: 4 HWs (50%) and 2 exams (50%), no curves. However, average for 2 exams combined was ~83%, same for all HWs combined. Must attend lecture as some things weren't in textbook. Overall, OK but never again.
Attending lectures is crucial as nothing is posted online and no textbook is used. You can get perfect scores in labs and projects (worth 40%) but doing average on exams (worth 60%) can cost you a letter grade or two. Moen isn't involved in grading so grades take ages since only TAs to grade everything. Bless the TAs for making this class better!
Strict grade cutoffs and no curving. I had him in 1913 too and enjoyed how easy it was, but after hearing about what other people learned and did in those classes, I feel as though I missed out. Moen's assignments are easy, but you get nothing out of them. Exams are also only a few questions so easy to get a bad grade if you get one question wrong.
Moen is a good lecturer but grades are based on far too few things. I am taking 4041 with him as well and we are given virtually no prep work before exams making it difficult to understand what you are even supposed to be studying for. Based on prior reviews, it seems as if he has increased difficulty substantially from previous semesters.
2 midterms(15 percent each) and 1 final exam are worth 60% of your grade. Labs and projects are not too bad and TA's will be of great help. But those exams are make it or break it. He spends weeks on certain concepts you'd expect to show up in a exam but no, he tests on things he considers "easy" or "self explanatory" and are absolute curveballs.
Moen lectures fairly well, but everything else is terrible. He doesn't post any notes so attending lecture is important. Grading criteria is ambiguous and focuses on specific details rather than big picture. We didn't get our midterm1 grades back until right before midterm2. He is usually rude and condescending to people expressing concern.
Test heavy course that is graded by too few things. Grading takes a very long time.
After the online semester, the course structure changed immensely. The midterm and final are huge chunk of grade, making it highly unfair as compared to last couple semesters when there were no exams. There is no textbook, making it further difficult to study for exams. Professor is decent, but the way the course is structured is not good at all.
Very boring lectures but not too difficult... Maybe it's just me because all of the other reviews made it seem like it would be an enjoyable class (seriously is it just me? Did something change? I don't get it) but it was so dry I almost couldn't stand it. But you have to attend lectures because there's no other way to get the material.
I took McCamant's class during the coronavirus pandemic. Our class was mostly on track and following the syllabus at the start, but when everything got moved to online, it was as if the syllabus didn't exist. Instead of having 5 projects and 5 problems sets (as was the original plan), we ended up with 2 projects and 3 problem sets. Not recommended
Although the subject material was dry to begin with, Stephen McCamants monotone could put a hummingbird to sleep. He seems like one of those CSCI profs whose gigantic melon needs three steps of dumbing down concepts for 3000-level and below students. Gave us some difficulty point adjustments for his hard problem sets. Operates behind schedule.
First of all, 2021 is not impossible. The material scares kids, but with discipline and the right professor, it's fine. McCamant might not be that right professor. Projects were complex w/ little instruction, midterms were hell, and it was obvious he poured work onto his TA's. Just an overall drag on everyone involved.
This is the first time in history where they made the class slightly more passable. Actually way more passable. You get full lab credit if you just attend the labs. The key to passing is going to all labs, averaging 85-90% on all homework/hands-on assignments and averaging 45+ /100 on tests. (60+ is a C). The class is also curved in the end. GL!
This class arguably has one of the worst textbooks I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Don't expect any hand holding from the textbook if confused by the content. Very limited examples and Qian is not helped by teaching straight from the book. TA's were also not exceptionally helpful. You are better off learning from Youtube.
This class was so much harder than it could've been. There was one midterm worth 35% of your grade, the final was worth 45%, and the homework was worth 20%. The hw was also graded, and you had to do it by yourself. The average on the exams were Fs, but some people always got a perfect score. Lectures were boring and discussions were useless.
Homework is graded very harshly, and the tests are near impossible. The saving grace of Feng and this class is that it is all heavily graded on a curve. His lectures and broad explanations of topics were good though.
too hard!!!
When you ask questions, you often found the professor being repetitive and responding to your question, with your question, which does not help. TA are irresponsible, grading the assignments without letting you know what you did wrong in the assignment, which is important as the next assignment is closely related through sem. The schedul is a mess.
Really unorganized and is terrible at communicating a clear schedule. Feedback on assignments (which all build on each other) is often times late and incomplete. The actual content of the class is not hard, but the terrible leadership led to it still being a very stressful experience overall
Grading took forever; weekly quiz avg was between 60-70%. No teaching in lecture; only vague answers about the project. Artificially difficult because of conflicting information. I've had Kevin Wendt for another class and he was good. Just overwhelmed and underprepared for this class. It won't get better since he's taught it multiple times.
The TA team this semester really messed up with the grading part. Grades came up so slow and Criteria is not clear in each iteration. Kevin is a cool guy though, his lecture is pretty good.
His lecture was kind of boring. Disrespectful and would interrupt many times while a student is asking a question or expressing his or her ideas. Exams are huge and very detailed that requires lots of memorization.
She uses cards as notes and can be randomly rude to students. She's also not comfortable with tech. The semester project is long but structured. You'll end up self-teaching a lot. Yet, her grading makes up for it as you have ample time to do assignments, and going to class is a free 15%. Overall, it wasn't amazing, but not horrible either.
TL;DR - If you don't read the book you're screwed I don't understand the high marks for Gini, maybe it's because of the lower division classes. She's funny but probably the worst lecturer I've seen. Her lectures hardly touch on any of the material she expects you to know. You have to teach yourself entirely out of the book.
No textbook is a horrible condition for a class where the lectures are so incoherent. It's hard to learn the material when what you are told in lecture is wrong relatively frequently. Hard to have a clear sense of what we are supposed to know. Some assignments were so baffling they had to alter the instructions in the middle of the cycle. Avoid.
The homework seemed to be way harder than necessary and was quite unclear. Professor Boley is a nice guy and willing to help but his lectures were not helpful at all and were really boring. His quizzes were the most helpful things to study from for the tests. At least he allowed open book and open notes for tests, which were quite easy.
Took his class in Fall 2013, with 200+ students. He might not be good with teaching lower level classes but is really smart, also gives a lot of help in scoring points from assignments for pushing up your grade. He really wants his students to pass too, make sure you learn the concepts from his assignments and you should be fine! Bear with him :)
Everyday he would come into lecture and never had a clear plan on what to teach. He's very smart but not a very good teacher; he seldom used the book and you wouldn't know what to expect for the tests. That being said, the final exam was easy and there was curving here and there. Just read the book and go to TA office hours and you'll be fine.
He is good at what he teaches, but the way he teaches is absolutely horrible. He makes a very easy concept hard to understand, and he spends 30min trying to make it clear, then you realize he was talking about something like 1+1=2. If I were him, I teach 3 times faster. I recommend reading the book yourself rather than listening to his babbling.
HW is way harder than material covered in class and questions are so vague so you have to keep going back and forth to office hr for clarification. Grades are not representative at all for the level of understanding of the material since grading is so harsh. Exams are feasible but very tight on time. Not worth the anxiety, I repeat.. not worth it.
This class is hard, but Gopalan makes it harder. He assumes students are familiar with the course topics so he isn't great at dumbing them down, he can be rude to students who ask questions (though he hasn't been to me yet), a lot of his examples are left unfinished, and the HW/tests are WAY beyond what he actually covers. Thank god for the curve.
Try your best to avoid this professor. Lectures are long and unclear, exams are very difficult and you aren't given enough time to complete them. You're given enough time for the Homework assignments but because the lectures are unclear you're going to either struggle for hours or just go to TA office hours constantly.
Lectures are pretty boring but the material is interesting. The homeworks are wordy and frustrating but you do learn a lot about functional programming. Definitely do the labs as they are very similar to the homework and tests.
The material is cool, but somehow Nadathur makes it awful. I performed above average in the class but I also skipped everything I could! He'll talk for what feels like hours about a simple thing, obfuscating it the whole time. He's also not very respectful to struggling students. I never witnessed someone living in an ivory tower until this class.
The material is not hard. It really isn't. In fact, functional programming is pretty fun. But somehow he manages to say so much and yet say nothing at all when explaining. Esoteric, confusing, run-on explanations with no purpose. If you absolutely have to take 2041 with him, READ THE CORNELL RECITATIONS ONLINE. Infinitely more lucid and enjoyable.
Uses a separate website instead of the university Canvas. All grades are posted on GitHub, and there are no clear letter grade constraints. He has a very heavy accent, and his lectures are mediocre at best. Uses Piazza to answer questions. Honestly just a bad professor.
I had to constantly compare this class with Zhai's 2021 class in order to convince myself that isn't so bad. Gopalan tends to make everything sound complicated than necessary and I found the lecture slides to be more helpful than his own explanations. I mostly relied on his slides and resources which is not ideal if you're looking for a decent prof
I don't feel like the material is hard. I really don't. Yet homework can make you go insane and you are stuck with minimal resources to get anything working. It's not reasonable to assume that every time one is stuck on Hw that they will visit a TA. Ta's were minimal in providing direct and personal help! Also, last quarter of semester we rushed!!
The lectures for this class were not very helpful or reflective of the content we were expected to know/apply for projects and labs. TAs are very helpful on assignments. The midterms were unnecessarily long and difficult.
Goplan structures 2041 to be unnecessarily hard with an unnecessary amount of work. There is so much work that in fact it takes away from your ability to learn since the focus is now on getting it done instead of learning the material to master the problem. If I did not already have career opportunities it would question my desire to continue C.S.
Gopalan does not care much for his students in regards to academic progress. While he does try his best to have us learn the class and understand it fully, the extent to which students can actually do this is not taken into account by him.
no
Gives a lot of tedious, badly worded homework, which varies wildly in difficulty. Lectures mandatory, and are either boring grinds through long examples, or speeding through slides way too fast to understand anything. Programming assignments have little opportunity for partial credit.
Unreasonably difficult teacher. Expects you to drop 50 hours on a project while giving out confusing homework, studying for exams and also having to juggle your other classes all at the same time. Midterm right after thanksgiving break. Doesn't accommodate. No sample exams to study from. Lectures are very vague. No recorded lectures at all.
Exam questions are based off of what was in the homework. Personally I never opened the textbook. You need to go to lecture and participate to do well in this class imo. Start working on projects and homework as early as possible. She is a bit disorganized but is clearly a very smart person.
She is friendly and knowledgeable. She wants students to get satisfactory marks. I understand her, but homework grading is too slow. The exam is heavily based on homework, but students cannot get grades and answers for the homework before the exam. The homework is so difficult that even TAs can't solve my problem in office hour.
Her lectures were a mess. Hard to understand since she mumbles and talks slowly. I just skipped lectures and watched the lecture videos 2x speed. Projects/hw are hard in that the TA's also have difficulty helping you. 2 take-home midterms (30%) and 1 2-hour final (30%). Even though I ended an A, I didn't learn anything. The curve is huge for course
She is easily the least responsive and least approachable prof I've had. She's an okay lecturer though, and that's really the important thing in a class like this. She knows the course material very well, and she she answers questions reasonably well. Grading standards are clear and fair.
Lectures were unhelpful and tests were deadly. On the bright side, my final grade of 75% turned into an A because of the massive curve. She seems to have something of a sense of humor and a good understanding of the material, but that does not at all translate into teaching ability.
Probably the most difficult class I've taken so far at UMN. The professor's accent was difficult to understand at times. Some labs were near impossible to finish without collaboration and the average assignment score was typically around 60%.
Probably one of more important classes you'll take at the U, unfortunately Prof. Zhai doesn't do anything to make it eaiser. Powerpoint slides are always read directly off of, usually with little/no further explanation.I felt the class was organized poorly, seems everything was just rushed. If you have her, know the book like the back of your hand!
Incredibly difficult class. Lecture notes do not cover the material in-depth, and neither do the assigned readings. Office hours are almost mandatory to even get the slightest grasp of the material. Homework assignments are unworkable until they are worked through by a teaching assistant.
She only reads from slides. Projects need extra work with vague descriptions and the instructor keeps adding requirements. Take the course with someone else.
Advanced Algorithm and Data Structure is a very hard course. Don't expect an A in this course. This is my second time taking this course with this specific professor. Don't recommend 5421 with this prof.
He is not helpful at all. He will try to gauge you according to you marks in assignments and exams(he usually calls out your name before handing out your checked assignment) and take you accordingly which is kind of biased.Also, the course itself is tough but enjoyable but don't expect anything from prof/TA in terms of grading.They hate giving grad
Rui seems like a nice guy, but his lectures are hard to follow. But again, it is a difficult class.
Unfortunately, he doesn't explain things well and his lectures are not helpful for homework, which are extremely difficult, very open-ended. There is no way to provide feedback. The homework instruction is extremely unclear. It is not a good course to help you learn. It only makes people struggle.
The majority of his lecture is spent on derivations and proofs and very little is spent on big picture or applied topics. Very often to have typos, does not explain things clearly. Hard to follow.
As a professor he has a lot of room to grow. 90% of lecture is spent on derivations/proofs and very little is spent on big picture or applied topics. When he starts a new algorithm he likes to move backwards; he starts with the math/details and then he might move on to the main idea behind it instead of starting with the big idea and drilling down.
Not very good. His accent is thick, and he does not explain the material at all. Even if you do listen in class, be prepared to study on your own. Keep up on the material.
His lectures aren't necessarily helpful. I love his grading policies because they give you multiple chances to improve upon your scores, whether it be for midterms or homework assignments. However, you get very little feedback on a lot of the material and sometimes you don't have them by the time you take the midterm, which sucks.
Favonia is an alright teacher, but your learning will be more understandable if you and try and learn from the textbook and your assignments more than his lectures. Often times they are confusing and I think I learn more from every other source.
You either understand Favonia's lectures, or you don't. If you don't you probably won't receive any extra help as Favonia isn't very clear at explaining things. Even with homework, he refuses to assist you beyond the basics. For example, he'll just explain what the error a compiler is giving rather than helping you solve the error.
The department needs to to take action with this man's lecture methods. Embarrassing that he has already been receiving such feedback for years already yet has made no changes. He obviously is math smart but a complete moron in the sense of logistics.
He sometimes seems to be reading content on slides for the first time along with us. 2 exams carry 50% of grade. Extremely tough when evaluating projects. No one got above 90% of project score. All assignments are from textbook. And they seem like random problems which don't help in understanding material. He clearly doesn't want to teach
He seemed to know what he was talking about, but he really only just reads from textbook-provided lecture slides and assigns homework from the text, as well. His lectures are dry, but the content wasn't too hard. I did poorly because I outright skipped one of the assignments. All-in-all, fine.
Do not take unless you have a interest in databases stronger than your self-respect. Long, boring lectures using slides from the textbook publisher. Tests involve a lot of random definitions you are expected to recall on the spot, rather than applying knowledge.
Get ready to teach yourself. Lecture is nothing more than an overview of topics. You need to read the book in detail to have a chance of passing. Homework problems from the book are seemingly selected randomly and are not an indicator for what'll be on the exam. I regret taking this course with him. I don't want it spoon fed, but this was sad.
4707 was an incredibly dull class. The lectures were not engaging in the least, and as many have said, slides were adopted straight from the book's website. Also, if you want to actually learn SQL, I wouldn't recommend this professor. You won't actually use a computer, and any "coding" you do will be with pen/paper.
I believe he knows a lot and he has industrial experience, but he is a bad lecturer. He uses slides from the book website without looking at them before coming to class, so it takes him a few sec to process the slides and his lectures are somewhat unorganized. Half of the homework problems and some exam questions are not even mentioned in lectures.
He speaks very very fast with a heavy accent i and couldn't understand him. I was a good student with GPA 3.6 when I took this course in my 4th year, got a C or C- (the lowest grade from all major classes (majored in computer science). This was the worst course I took throughout my life, from all the BS and MS level courses that I took.
Ok Professor.
Not a good class at all. He doesn't look at problems before he assigns them and doesn't teach to what is on the homework or the test.
It is the worst class I had ever attended. very few explanation.
He has got this attitude problem that he graduated from berkeley and he is the best. He is proud that he is friends with a lot of big writers. He thinks he is always right but no. He never comes prepared to the lecture and reads the slides copied from the writers website. The slides are full of mistakes and really sloppy. He doesn't care.
Homework was easy; however, assigned problems changed a day or two before due. Tests not really related to HW problems. Very unspecific about what topics will be tested. Babbles a lot. and there was NO PRACTICE of Databases.
Choose Kulffman. DO NOT CHOOSE Jack Kolb. His exam does not open laptop but the Kulffman does, and every time I got like round to 10 pages for my two midterm, my friend who chose Kulffman only have 1-2 pages, and they open laptop.
He knows his stuff but the lectures are all theory based and never applied to computer science. It makes it hard to learn the content and becomes more memorization for the quiz then forget it. Would not recommend for someone who actually wants to apply linear algebra. Great for someone who wants to learn the theory behind it all.
Carl's lectures were extremely theoretical and proof based. He didn't do many examples in class which made it hard for me to understand material. His weekly exam's were always pretty easy but the textbook that was required was often times hard to understand without supplemental material. I would try to avoid him.
Carl is a funny and nice person. However, the way he teaches linear is more like taking discrete math than a calc class; lots of proofs. Talking with others who are taking 2033 with other professors, they had no idea what we were doing when looking at our homework. Linear is important for learning AI/CV. Don't take it with Carl.
Carl has a reputation at the U so I was excited to have him but sadly it wasn't as good as I expected. His lectures are all theory and very haphazard. Homework is almost impossible. The times I asked for help he was rude. He says his exams are easy but they were always hard. 30% final. No curves. Luckily grading is shifted down so 60% is C level
Grade is based on weekly quizzes and a final, which aren't too hard. Carl's lectures are practically all theory with very few examples. I learned the content by watching the 3Blue1Brown videos on linear algebra and reading the textbook. He sends out plenty of practice problems, though, and as long as you stay on top of those you'll be fine.
Snobby and aggressively-written Syllabus, doesn't do make-up quizzes for ANY absences (even for sport clubs, etc.). Lectures are repetitive and confusing, make you feel like you have no clue what's going on. Prepare to have to teach yourself anything you don't understand because he barely ever answers questions during lecture.
Carl goes over too much theory and proofs in every lecture with very few examples and I didn't learn anything from lecture. I learned everything by reading the book and doing practice problems. The quizzes and final were not that difficult tho. If you can take it with another professor, don't choose Carl.
Had Prof. Carl for 2011 and 2033 and am really not a big fan based on my learning style. His lectures are theory and proof heavy with no practical examples similar to quiz questions. I know some people that absolutely love him and others that don't so it's just up to how you like to learn. Very smart guy though, really knows his material.
Carl has the ability to make things seem more complicated and confusing than they actually are. On YouTube, TheTrevTutor will help with 2033 and hhp3 will be a lifesaver for 4011. As long as you do the textbook exercises/problems then the quizzes won't be that difficult.
Goes very in depth into concepts/hypotheticals, few implementations leaving me extremely lost trying to follow, and the few he does are in inconsistent pseudocode. Textbook also pseudocode, theoretical. Class reminds me of Umbridge, 'if you know the theory well, you should be able to do it in practice, w/o practice'. Take Moen/Taylor instead
Does not use concrete examples, pretty much only talks in the abstract in lectures. There was never numbers on the board in a linear algebra class. Only take if very comfortable thinking in the abstract. I had to learn a lot from the textbook and youtube videos. Said the finals were easy but they're really not.
(also had him for 2033) I liked him at first because of his soft accent and calming voice, but the lectures are excruciatingly boring and for the most part useless. He does a lot of theory and proofs instead of examples and actual math, and e uses completely different notation than the textbook. I also found him to be quite rude when talking to him
Have fun trying to learn math without numbers! All the recent reviews here are 100% true, and his lectures are so abstract to the point where it's hard to learn from them. Easy class to pass, but you'll have to teach yourself.
I don't think I learned a single thing during his lectures. He approaches things in an abstract/proof based way which is fine in some cases, but an example here or there wouldn't kill you. Also will jump around sections as he pleases without saying a word and won't post the practice questions for a week after you cover it makes keeping up hard.
BRUH - I've never studied so hard in my life. His lectures are USELESS. I usually read it off from the book and SLADER<3 or YouTube. He doesn't provide any examples in his lectures. Sometimes I just want a car to hit me before going into his 2011/2033 classes cuz it's painful going to lecture knowing that it wouldn't be very helpful on his quizzes.
Carl likes to think he's making everything "overtly" clear. Hey bud, you aren't. This is an abstract math course. None of this stuff past like Ch. 4 is very "overtly" clear. Dumb it down a bit - not everyone here writes Ph.D level research papers on bijections for fun. He's also "overtly" harsh. (He always says "overtly..")
He's very helpful in office hours. However, since grading is done by TA's, it's common to not know what's expected. Some TA's demand intricate proofs even if the problem doesn't, and some don't. Carl himself had a habit of noticeably trying to over complicate subjects with the intention of being confusing. Nevertheless, the class is very easy.
He assume you have a lot of experience in internet programming, some homeworks are very time consuming. What's more, he rescale his grading policy which made you loose more points while unchanging his grading scale.His lecture is useless, if you have to go to his class, you had better learn text books(3 books, total 2700 pages) by yourself first
He is a more lively professor than most, but his lectures still are quite boring. Projects are very tedious and a true pain. Bright side is that they do usually prepare you quite well for exams.
Kauffman's lectures are charming and widely very helpful, according to people I've talked to. However, it didn't jive with me, and I was berated and patronized in office hours for not "listening in lecture" when I definitely did, and just didn't understand and Kauffman couldn't wrap his head around that, which felt really awful.
Kauffman is a good professor but he's not a good human. I value being nice and respectful to your students more than just teaching well. He thinks of himself as the supreme authority. He knows what he's teaching but lacks any kind of empathy for students. Never gonna take his class again because I don't wanna feel this disrespected again.
The only reason this guy gets any good reviews is because every CSCI professor at this UNI is terrible. He just happens to be the best of the bad, which doesn't say much at all. Makes no effort to help you learn, but rather piles you with assignments and says good luck. Classes are awful and so is his ability to teach
Professor Chiang is a pretty nice dude and wants to help you succeed (he is willing to give extensions and stuff), but the grading criteria for hw (60% of the grade) and the project are extremely strict. If your test case doesn't pass, you get 0 points, so no partial credit. The project is based off the hw too so good luck if you didn't get the hw.
His CSCI 2033 has been pretty fair and chill so far. The quizzes are extremely easy and you can get the homework done within two days with the help of a TA visit. My only complaints are that his lectures aren't the best and the final to his class made me want to pull my hair out. The final was one of the hardest exams I ever had to take. L.
Virtually zero resources outside of the textbook. Lectures are unhelpful. No slides, and notes posted online were sloppy. By midterms I was teaching myself the material. For a complicated subject, the lectures should be more engaging.
Absolutely brutal lectures with poor explanations of the material, you're better off just reading the book and going to office hours. The quiz questions are way harder than the recommended problems, and he gives absolutely no resources outside of the book to help learn. genuinely doesn’t care about his students.
Shashi is a nice guy. But the course material is dry and outdated. Topics covered are not helpful for data science jobs in the industry. I would avoid 5715.
He gives out wayy too much homework for a labless course.
A poor choice for this introductory course. He is clearly more familiar with database upper division courses. Every lecture consisted of him reading his mutilated stock textbook PowerPoints, and when quizzes and the final came around, nobody I have talked too seemed prepared; the content tested was simply not discussed in the detail expected.
This teacher has a heavy Indian or Pakistani accent and is often hard to understand because he speaks softly and towards the board rather than the class. He is effective at explaining concepts when he tries but often he glosses over topics and just reads the powerpoint presentations that came with the textbook. His TAs were helpful though.
speaks in monotone speaks in monotone speaks in monotone speaks in monotone speaks in monotone speaks in monotone speaks in monotone speaks in monotone boring boring boring boring boring boring boring......ZZZZZZZZ Please do not teach again. May be a scholar but obviously not a 'teacher'.
He as a person, seems very nice and personable. His material however, since he dosen't post lecture videos, you gotta be at lectures, which isn't great, so you probably have to self teach, especially if you don't know java. Tests were really hard for me, but I'm not the brightest. Wish he curved everyone and not "case by case" for final grades.
Read not-sure-yet as A/A-. Chris Dovolis isn't a wonderful lecturer or teacher -- bland, hand-writes code during lecture, and doesn't post any lecture materials online. And self studying isn't an option, because he uses definitions inconsistent with his online resources/textbooks and there are occasional participation group-pop-quizzes. Tests mid.
He is a very smart professor, but he has a couple of key issues. One, he doesn't post notes and expects you to take notes verbatim and as someone who likes to look back at things, it made it difficult. Second, he assigned two projects due on the same day as the final midterm. Three Midterms are pretty much your grade and you have to study a lot.
High standards Professor. Pretty boring in class, not the best if you're newer to coding/compsci.
Tests determine your whole grade... lectures are not very clear and have poor coding examples.
Terribly worded tests. You have to guess what the questions mean. Lectures were irrelevant. The projects and labs were way too much work for only a weight of 30% total. The projects and labs were fun, though.
Really boring lectures.
You have to work hard in this class! It prepares you well for workload that 2021 and 2041 will dump on you.
Class structure is set up awfully. Tests account for huge chunks of the grade (like 80% I believe), projects that take like 10 hours to do only account for 4% each. Miss 2 labs and automatically fail. Refuses to use github to submit so you have to go in person to talk to the TAs to submit. Teaches poorly so you're better of using the textbook.
Terrible wording
The assignments and projects were completely managed by the TA's and not Dovolis. His tests were totally different and often tried to "trick us" unnecessarily and we spent most of the time trying to understand what the question was asking. I learned a lot and I feel that if I took tests relating to assignments and projects, I would do way better.
This course is one of toughest required class in cs major. However, he made this course tougher. If you go to this course without pre-study, you will have no idea what he is talking about. He often made mistake during the lecture. Sometime you may have doubts if he knows what he is talking. Overall you need to be ready to self-study in this class.
I thought he was a pretty chill dude. His lectures seemed to ramble quite a bit. However, I don't think the grades for the class reflect mastery of the material taught as the 70% of your grade from the tests overemphasized points in passing and neglected topics discussed in depth.
It was quite a hard class. Honestly learned slim to nothing in lecture, but I didn't pay attention too well. You really need to focus during lecture. Labs and projects took up a LOT of time, and were quite hard, but make sure you understand them because tests won't be any easier. Tests are overall random. Theres no real way to study or prepare.
I enjoyed Dovolis' lectures at the beginning of the semester. As time went on, however, I realized he really does not do a good job at teaching the class, and is very lazy when it comes to the course. It looked like the TAs handled every aspect about the course except for the lectures/exams. TAs were very helpful, would not pass without their help.
Run! (Away)
At first, I really didn't mind Dovolis' somewhat lazy teaching tactics because the material was not that difficult to understand and the first midterm was relatively easy (average was 88% ). However, I noticed how unhelpful his teaching methods can be when he taught data structures and the next midterm proved that (average was 57%). TAs really help
He spends a lot of time lecturing on topics relevant to the projects he assigns (e.g. the bus simulation), but doesn't go into too much detail on any of the more complex data structures/algorithms that we cover (e.g. merge sort). The average score on the second midterm was a 52%, and he didn't even acknowledge it in class.
I really like Dovolis as a person. He's comical and isn't insanely boring. His ability to teach, however, is lost on many of his students. 2021 is hard regardless of the teacher, but I've had Dovolis previously and while I love his personality, I just don't think I could make it through another one of his classes.
I took this class on the recommendation of my adviser & felt as if my time was wasted. It seemed to me that the prof spent very little time preparing for our class because if was for non-majors. The labs were disconnected & often flawed. The homework took a ridiculous amount of time for the little help it offered in understanding the material.
One of the most painful classes I've ever taken. So dry and dull that every student lacked motivation, and by the end of it, we were only coming in to lectures to give him a bad evaluation. Homework is long, labs are so disconnected from lecture I thought I was in the wrong computer lab, and we only started learning Python in the last three weeks.
Someone else said that Chris has a "Dad" way of teaching, and they're right. Chris seems like a nice guy and generally tries to engage his students, however, he tests his students on more than what he covers in lecture and in readings. Problem sets and tests are a pain and don't reflect the class. Save your GPA and don't take a class with him.
Chris's often devotes most of his lectures to edge cases instead of making the base material clearer. It is extremely difficult to actually parse the information you'll need to pass from lectures.
He is a tough grader. Although it seems that you have reviewed and learnt materials very well, you may still bomb midterms and final. He curves the class, but it is not a huge curve. There is not much thing you can do with grade. However, he teaches simulation, which is very interesting and challenging.
Gets confused a lot by the material and will sometimes be unable to solve the problem at hand. Even in office hours he gets confused a lot. People say he's the best professor for this class and he is because he himself doesn't know what he's doing so he makes the exams easier.
Dovolis' lectures did not give enough clear direction and guidance for learning how to program. He went on and on about irrelevant information when he should have given applied examples of coding. The tests were difficult and partial credit was given sparingly. The labs and homework were at a difficult level WAY above the lecture material.
Excellent, engaging lecturer. However beware!! Great lectures are all you'll get from Dovolis. He doesn't deal with any grading, and he deflects all questions to his TAs. Not helpful, but also not that hard. Tests were a little frustrating because they focus on the points he makes in the tangents he goes on in lectures. But overall, alright.
Good speaker but speeds through material, tests were full of trick questions, assignments took an unrealistic amount of time to complete
The projects were a total mess. The final lab was ran by a TA and if you were not in his section understanding and completing the lab was out of the question. He often was side tracked.
He is an engaging lecturer, and in class you have the sense that you are keeping up just fine. Then you get an assignment to do, and it seems like it came from another class entirely. He has a very bad habit of explaining material AFTER you've turned in the assignment.
I agree with everyone else in that he's a nice guy, however he doesn't provide the class with all of the tools to complete the assignments without significant help nor is there enough assistance from the teacher's assistants. If this doesn't come naturally to you, or you don't have a strong group to study with then you're in trouble.
PROS: 1. Uses whiteboard over ppt 2. Energetic lectures delivery 3. Knowledgeable 4. Most content comes from textbook ----- CONS: 1. Not involved in the planning of labs 2. Highly unorganized and writes poor exams the night or day before the exam date 3. Unhelpful and seems uninterested in the success of his students 4. Demands lots of your time
One of the worst teachers I've ever had. I didn't find his teaching useful. He's also terrible at being an advisor.
I had Dovolis for 1901 and 1902. He made 1901 very fun and interesting for me. However, I had his night class for 1902. It was really hard for me to understand or learn anything. I think it was because it was a night class. Otherwise, he is very helpful.
He doesn't know what he is talking about, he seems funny and cool but once you get to know what's going on when you are a junior or senior in computer science, you will come to know he is awful.
Dovolis is a cool guy. He's funny, he's chill and he's awkwardly amusing. He is also unorganized, has no idea what he's talking about half the time (seriously. the TA keeps correcting him and he just laughs it off), and he comes into class 5, 10, 15 or 20 minutes late far too regularly for a 50 minute class.
Chris is a very nice guy, and he likes students, but not very good as a teacher. Our TA could explain stuff better, and final exams were based on material that he barely covered.
He's an okay professor for 1901 but is less than mediocre for 1902. He missed two days and never covered the material he missed. NOT okay.
Although I ended up with an A I didn't feel like the lectures were helpful at all. He made everything sound very complicated by developing a few lectures on every little subject. I never read the book, except from a few pages for a couple of confusing labs. Unfortunately the class requires having pop quizzes (10% of the grade) so you don't want to
Although he's a nice guy, I'd have to say I'm not a big fan of Dovolis. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Usually he started class by correcting errors he made in previous lectures. He often was unable to answer student questions. If you don't understand the material, it's tough to teach it.
Not very knowledgable. Made mistakes on the board, very 80s style with bad jokes.
Shana's mediocre teaching was difficult to appreciate through her outright refusal to be compromising or accommodating in any way, shape, or form, even after replacing a professor that kicked the bucket. Condescending, harsh, and sometimes outright mean.
totally depends on your learning style, she's so frantic and rambles a lot but is a super easy grader. class has barely any structure and she's not the best at answering specific questions. lots of group work but not necessarily weekly homework. she's super smart and knowledgable but hard to follow sometimes. read the textbook to understand!
She was terribly disorganized and condescending, but an easy grader overall. Take her class if you're looking for the credit and nothing else.
Shana is a poor lecturer, she goes on rabbit trails for every question. She constantly goes on about how her instructions are very clear, but in reality they are not and require lots of explanation. She is a nice grader :)
Good class structure. Easy grading. VERY BAD explanations. Student asks simple question: A Shana answers questions: Q, F, C, and L. Student is left confused and unanswered.
Dr. Watters has a very "rambly" style of lecturing. It's hard to get a direct, succinct explanation of something because explanations tend to deviate to many other related concepts. This makes her lectures really difficult to follow-along and pay attention to.
I Don't Like by Chief Keef
He's not as bad as people say overall. He is AWFUL at lecturing, and I've never seen such unclear instructions for homeworks and labs. But he's a nice guy who is accommodating.
Joosten knows the material well, but isn't great at explaining it. At first the course was manageable and even enjoyable. But the final project is way too advanced for the fundamentals we learned regarding it. Feels like trying to build a house with ten sticks and a rock. He's at least sympathetic and has been giving out as much help as possible.
really sweet and intelligent professor, however, makes 2041 course like a 5xxx/8xxx course. Homeworks are tough in exchange for "easier" midterms. Final project is insanely difficult & complexed for 2xxx course, will find yourself spend more time in this lower-level course than higher-level. Academically challenging, rough course structure.
its whatevr u hv read from other comments, excpt worst for this sem. 1 final proj=20% final grade which only the grad TA knows n other TA not know how to do. caused an uprising within the class hw, labs n midterms r doable tho if you really want to take his class, gamble with your life and mental health that he will not give the final proj this sem
The final project is the downfall of this class. I understand why it is important and good material to teach but the write up and helpful information is buried in slides and it makes the whole class feel lost. If there was a pdf writeup of what we were expected to do and the different progress points, the project would be drastically better.
Although I went to lectures every single time (graded attendance), I found that I learned basically nothing at all from them. The entirety of my learning came from the textbook and being in office hours. A lot of the time I found myself completely lost during the lecture. Somehow I managed to do well enough on the exams.
The lectures for this class were not helpful at all in the beginning of the term, and after the first two tests had subpar grades--a curve, grade weight, and change up his lecture style were implemented, which helped. The discussion sections for this class were also far more helpful than lectures. Overall a nice guy, just not the best lecturer.
This course was a rollercoaster. Sebastiaan's lectures are very rough, but he's a nice guy and is willing to implement student feedback. The HW is tough, but they're graded on completion. The midterms and the final are similar to the practice versions. Also, he had to curve the class so that 60% or higher was passing and changed the exam weights.
just don't do it. every good review says something along the lines of he used to suck but got better/cares blah blah. why would you want a mid professor who doesn't know how to teach over the other amazing profs here? take someone else, actually ENJOY your classes, save your GPA. trust me.
In this class all he does is read off of the slides that on 10 feet above him. IF you need to take him, just dont even bother going to lecture.Just watch youtube videos, go to weekly discussion, do all homework. do the 2 TH exams (similar 2 midterm) and you will be able to pass atleast with a C. LECTURES from him are a waste of time.
lectures r a waste of time. Seems like a nice guy I guess but grade just weighs too heavily on exams. he does take criticism very well though n has changed the grading scale after ppl fumbled on the first midterm. if ur not a great test-taker avoid for your own sanity.
Professor Joosten is definitely an interesting professor who knows a lot about Discrete Mathematics. However, I believe that his teaching style could use a bit of refining. I believe that he needs to truly slow down on important subjects and thoroughly explain the topics, explaining his thinking elaborately and at a basic understandable level.
Shoutout to the people who asked him if they should drop the course. The curve simply saved my grade
It is obvious that he is passionate in his field of study, but passion does not a good professor make. Not only are his slides often verbatim to the textbook, but he breezes past them at a pace that is just unreasonable. His reasoning to exclude a curve is just unrealistic and it's exclusion is more of a detriment than anything else.
This is the first C+ I ever gotten from a class. I thought the difficulty and load was just how programming works, but looking at the other reviews, it turns out he's just a stressful professor by giving us very complex homework assignments. The zybooks were redundant too. If you love having mental burnouts, this is the class for you.
Tim is knowledgable in many regards, but the man needs to not teach an introductory programming class. The key to survive is previous programming experience. His lectures lacked helpful methods of teaching a subject foreign to many. Instead, Tim elects to share useless info about his career and 'prehistoric' methods of computing.
I would recommend you take CSCI 1115, because it helps you get a kick start on concepts that will be taught in class later and also get familiar with problem solving in C++. Tim's a sweet person himself but the way he teaches is really a hit or miss. Super difficult homework for an intro class is assigned every week. Come to office hours!!!
I am very fortunate that I have met a very good TA, and I have learned most of the skills in the lab. The key to getting an A is the test, remember not to give up in the test, write as much as you can, TA will give you enough grades
Going into this class, I thought it was a beginner coding class. I was wrong. You are expected to already have a basis in computer coding before starting this class. Without a background in computers, you're behind. I took this class as a requirement for my Psychology major and it was way too hard.
Lectures were often difficult to understand or straight up nonexistent. There were too many in-class assignments on things that we didn't know how to do yet, due to him not lecturing on them. I relied heavily on the labs to learn anything in this class, which I guess is normal for a compsci class. However, lectures were essentially pointless.
Pros: 1) likeable 2) knowledgeable 3) showing up is easy (but little amount of) points Cons: 1) tangents 2) vague responses 3) hard-to-read slides 4) starts class late 5) somewhat unprepared Often, we end up starting lecture late, he goes on tangents about complicated comp sci and back in my day stuff. Hes a nice person though.
Take notes. Take detailed notes. The tests were nightmares but they were open note. The amount of work for the credit total you get in this class is not worth it. Be good to your TA's they do a majority of the grading in this class. Go to office hours and make sure you understand. Be sure to do your best on the projects they make or break you.
I was taking this class as a math credit and wish I didn't. He isn't accommodating to students, but stopped recording lectures because it was "too much for him to do". I asked him to explain how to start our first project, and he said "it's pretty self explanatory". He doesn't seem to care about whether or not his students pass his classes.
Wrenn's lectures were innefective at best, and actively impeding learning at it's worst. A facade of difficulty was built up around this class, when in reality it was fairly easy due to how the project was graded. Wrenn frequently bragged and acted unprofessional towards students. No disrespect, however, as he always acted fair and was respectful.
A decent professor. Seems unprepared a lot of the times as he would post projects days after he said he would originally post it. This causes the deadline for projects to be right before the day of exams. In my experience, he will mostly read off the powerpoint and sprinkle some facts in between, or brag about himself.
she's a good professor for computer science to those who have taken a computer Science class before. if you have never taken a computer Science class before DO NOT HAVE HER AS A TEACHER!!!! she will be no help.
I had her this semester at Augsburg, and I gotta say, she gave no leniency whatsoever despite the pandemic... She was kind, definitely, but she always expected us to just know things. When id reach out for help, instead of answering my questions directly, shed answer it with another question... Also very disorganized and replies late to emails.
Her lectures are often boring and confusing. Lots of tricky quizzes and it is hard to study. For projects, it is way harder to understand what's going on than to code. Luckily, we get lots of help for this class with plenty of office hours. Larson or TAs also respond to most emails regarding code issues/debugging help, which is actually unusual.
super disorganized class: bugs in base code, vague & changing proj requirements, slow grading (but tends to be lenient). lectures not helpful. makes you wonder if she actually cares. mandatory lab signup. lots of work (last few weeks were ok, but still...). this class would be easier if you already had significant experience with c++.
One on one, Prof Larson is really willing to help you. But this class was extremely disorganized with the projects and I really didn't feel like I learned much. The given code for the project already had a ton of bugs in it and the requirements were constantly changing. The quizzes were objective and hard to argue points back for.
Pro - she assigns a lot of homework and in-class quizzes that help you learn better than any other CSCI class I've taken here (2021,2041,3081,4061). Con - Larson just isn't very smart. Her lectures are really unclear, and you're better off reading the book. It's also annoying that questions can be worded very unclearly in exams/hw.
Overall class is somewhat interesting and the homework will make you learn about searches and some AI problems. Overall this last semester was a disaster on the topic of getting feedback. On work turned in mid October there were no grades posted until after we had taken the final. Overall the class had very poor structure, and feedback.
Lectures are unclear and unengaging. The professor seems to want students to succeed but wants nothing less than to give the students more resources other than the textbook. Attendance is optional but may as well be mandatory given that you'd be stuck reading the incredibly dense textbook otherwise.
Lectures were youtube videos posted from last fall, and many of them didn't really help as well as they should have for homework. She is very hard to reach via email/oh, but the ta's were solid. Class is probably much better in person, but a real dissapointment via online class.
Such a hard class, prof and ta are not well organized, give you hints that gets you nowhere
School has been online this semester and Kate has probably been the worst professor I have ever had and is managing her course through covid very poorly. She has been doing a terrible job making herself available and offering any extra help to students. Literally does not have her email to contact her on canvas even and is flying through material
Im a fairly agreeable student and havent had many negative prof experiences... but boy, Kate Jensen is one of them. Not only is she EXTREMELY condescending, her lectures arent helpful for the homework or tests, the homework is graded so severely, and the grading standards are skewed with 95% required for an A. Never again.
Professor Jensen takes a very theory/mathematical approach to Algorithms and Data Structures and to be perfectly honest, unless you have a future career in the academia, it is not the best approach for most people. I learned more reading out of the textbook than listening to her lectures. She was very approachable and is a nice person though.
averages for exams were aorund 40%... and they were always rlly long exams for only 55 mins. always had projs due a day or two before exams, but did not teach enough to start projs early in advance. lectures were rlly long, but prof truly is passionate about the subject. it feels like she forgets this is all new to us, but she is willing to help
Strict deadlines, but only for his students. If I upload my quiz/project at 6:01pm I'll get a 0 but when he tells us he'll have the tester code up by Sunday, you won't see it until Thursday. I don't feel comfortable asking for help because he makes me feel stupid and unqualified as if I'm not here to learn how to do these things.
Honestly I don't get why everyone seems to love him. He's a decent professor and explains the difficult concepts as best as he can but his attitude is hard to deal with. He's "sassy" (read: unhelpful) when you try to ask for help. There's been worse professors but he's not as amazing as the other ratings make him out to be.
Grading sucks! Score got out really late.
Grading HW3 using: grade = raw * 0.4 + 60. That was SO RIDICULOUS! You can end up doing little and get above 60. lmao.
Terrible, terrible class. Homework and labs looks like they were written the night before on the Notes app on my iPhone. He has no rubric or clear expectations on what he's looking for. Of course, thats somewhat expected, but when graders start nit-picking it gets so annoying. The labs are tedious and vary wildly in the required work.
The lectures are fine but his homework is annoying. Especially homework 3.
Don is well... a very poor lecturer. He is a top tier yapper. He likes to sit in his desk in the front and type our URLs character by character. The class is decent, but most of the learning comes from outside sources.
this class is a joke i went to TA office hours and he was never there
Don't take this guy, lectures are just listening to him talk to himself and read off some ancient looking slides. Grading is a mess. The sad thing is that this is actually a pretty interesting subject, but it is a bore with Challou. Also he seems kind of racist
The lectures were generally hard to follow, especially during examples. He oftentimes referenced lectures from professors at other universities which were much more helpful than the lectures in class. Additionally, attendance was very heavily weighted (~15% of the grade). Outside of this, he seems like a nice guy.
Challou bumbles around during lectures reciting slides that he very clearly does not have a good understanding of. His homeworks feel very poorly assembled and have you do tedious useless problems.
Professor Challou was such a nice guy but I didn't like what he taught. I felt like I didn't learn anything and he would just do examples in class instead of teaching. There is so much busywork in the beginning and the tests are annoying because you have to produce code under pressure which I feel isn't a great indicator of knowledge
Homeworks can take a decent amount of time. Some of them are a lot longer than others. Dan is probably the most disorganized professor I've ever had; constant mistakes in his slides and write ups. Tests are worth a disgusting amount of your grade for a class like Internet Programming, where you mostly just do projects.
It's like he teaches you 1+1 2 in class but then expects you to do integration by parts for the homeworks
He has no idea he is teaching nothing in class.7 HWs basically throw to you and done by self-learning from Googling, the class is basically listening to him talking to himself, tests are 25% each, not really hard can basically google all of them. Restrict you from using this/that build in features which I found to be pointless,Personality alright.
Wastes a ton of time chalking up stuff on the board without any explanation. The course material is good but I haven't been to a single one of his lectures without feeling like I'm wasting my time. Class is easy if you've already done web dev work else I can see it being very confusing. Most of the learning is from figuring the project out on my ow
Professor presents examples and refers to w3schools and references to learn. I feel like there could be more structured learning and active process. He's a smart guy and decent professor, but very laid back. I feel that I would have gotten more out of the course had I taken it with the other professor, last semester.
Dan Challou is a meh professor. His lectures are fairly boring, homework are alright, gives random participation exercises in his class which is fairly annoying. Seems to have extensive industry experience which is good, but I never would want to work alongside him.
Dan was one of the worst professors I've had. Coming into CSCI 1133, there's gonna be a lot of different skill levels. I think he forgot about this little bit. His homework is graded super strictly, cannot teach well at all, doesn't give good examples and gives a lot of pop quizzes. Honestly don't take CSCI 1133 with him
Lectures are a waste of time. Literally posts links and youtube tutorials in his slides so you can actually start learning after lecture. Does participation exercises since if he didn't nobody would show up, except for when he randomly gives you 60% of the homework during lecture, which incentivizes procrastination. Loves trick questions -_-
Too much homework. Exams were heavy and didn't give enough time to do.
Lecture was once per week, 2.5 hrs. VERY dry and boring lectures-but you earn points for in class activities. You learn the bulk of the course material in lab, also once a week (3 hrs). Weekly homework assigned, and weighted heavily, as labs do not count toward your final grade. Although, you must pass 10 of 12 labs in order to pass the class.
Homework can take 6+ hours a week, and he gives pop quizzes in class without any notice. Anytime you ask a question, he always answers it in an extremely condescending way.
Read the book, pay attention to lecture and make sure you have a TA go over your homework before you turn it in. Don't expect a curve a lot of the people in your class are going to be really good at programming. Also if you're not an experienced programmer take the section for inexperienced people, that's my biggest regret.
The projects are hard and Challou will spend 4 or 5 lectures about the first tenth of a project (repeats material many times) and you have to break your head to figure out the rest. It seems like he does not know the material. finds creative ways to avoid answering questions. very harsh grading. unclear instructions for assignments. avoid Martha.
Lack of communication between the prof and TAs. Lectures take more than an hour to explain 15 minutes of material. Easy tests with trick questions. Teaches coding and communication methods that he sometimes follows. Most of the work is at the end of the class. Group projects are a trap and the only escape provided is to ditch your group.
Worthless lectures that are out of the book. He makes you come by giving random quizzes. If you read the book, do the homeworks and labs, you don't need to go to his lectures. Exams weren't tough, but were very congested, giving you no time to think things through.
The course material is not too difficult if you read the book and put effort into the weekly labs. Challou's lectures are really long and super hard to pay any attention to. He basically teaches straight out of the book, so the lectures aren't too helpful. There are several random quizzes though, so you do need to show up to lectures.
The cool part is one gets to learn how to write one's own programming language and how to build a translator from it to C++. The lame part is that the class is treating it as if it was like joining an organization called Cash$cam: with self-help books and articles each of which could be summarized in bullet points on a single slide.
If you are an A student and value your time and prune unnecessary activities because life is short, you'll probably get a B here. 10% of the grade is coming to class and labs where you'll be explained 5 minutes worth of material in 1 hour. 7.5% of the grade is doxygen. 15% of the grade is answering quiz questions about vocab from the reading.
This is apparently a class for people who are excellent C++ programmers, but who have no clue how to make a plan. He doesn't so much teach you as give you a pep talk about why making a plan is good and you should do it. Then you have to go home and write C++ code, which he never taught you. Annoying mandatory group project. Nice guy, though.
I believe that this was Dan's first time teaching, and it showed. His lectures were vague, inept, and included ludicrously inane participation exercises. The class was generally messy, and any structure it did have came from material and schedules inherited from prior professors. On the plus side, Challou's exams are very easy. Hope for a good TA.
The gap between the lecture and coding might be heavy for someone who doesn't fully comprehend the principles beneath it, especially the ones with a relatively weak math base. Requiring basic understanding of linear algebra and multi-variable derivative, not much difficulty in coding itself but students may struggle with realizing math process.
