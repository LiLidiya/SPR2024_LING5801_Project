Funny way to impart education
He is a hard teacher, but he can be really funny at times... he can be somewhat unclear though.
Fun professor that loves computer science. Riedl knows his stuff and presents well. He is sometimes unclear on grading criteria and gives vague requirements. Talk a lot and be friendly if you want to ensure a good grade. See him in person because he is very slow with email.
very good teacher. very knowledgeable on the subject he taught. could have made the grading a little bit easier, and the final project was no joke.
Course material is a bit dated. Lectures can be hard to follow, but are straight from the textbook (which he co-authored). Factor in lots of time for homework, especially the final assignment! Homework is all programming, but exams are mostly theory and will catch you out if you haven't brushed up on algorithms and analysis.
Karypis is a pretty good lecturer--a bit hard to understand at times, but usually clear. However, he assigns crushing amounts of homework. His programming assignments take 30+ hours of work and they are individual, not group assignments. His class was the most work-intensive I have ever taken, EVER. Do not take if you have other stuff to do.
Karypis is a friendly guy -- respectful towards students. Homeworks were generally easy - a couple programming assignments were TOO long IMO. Most annoying thing was it took FOREVER to get results. We're talking about weeks of waiting for test/homework grades -- and even final grades were posted several days after the official UofM deadline.
He a good professor who knows his materials but can be hard to undertstand at time. Must keep up in reading to understand the concept. Good professor to take class from as you will be make to think and you will know the meaning of studying from this professor.

Not too difficult of a class. Not much work. Class was just work time. Only pain was the daily quizzes of the videos online that had nothing to do with the class.
The professor is friendly and approachable but the course structure is pretty bad. Basically, you are expected to learn the materials yourself by watching coursera videos and quizzed on it every lecture. Also, it's pretty obvious that the instructors have minimal experience with Android so don't expect much with developing apps.
Course teaches about building app strategies. A lot of afterclass videos to watch. Do NEED good group to be successful. Project needs A LOT documentation. Expect writings. Presentation and paper weighs most. Very time consuming course ( 5 credits). Concepts are not hard. Recommend this prof if app is really your thing. You learn a lot. Easy test.
Loren was an awesome, very clear, very understanding professor, who really tried to instill in everyone the same passion for computer science as he clearly has.
This instructor gets his points across pretty well, but the lab exercises, while easy, don't give you any experience. This makes the assignments quite difficult to complete. Expect to spend a fair amount of time on each one.
For people who had never delt with OO programming the class might be somewhat challenging. The assignments are fairly challenging, expect to spend approx 10 hours on each assn. Tests are pretty good, all of the concepts are on sample tests or have been well covered in lecture. The lab is cake, just copy and paste code.Eclipse IDE is nice to work on
Expects a lot from students, in the forms of quizzes and projects. Offers a lot of help and is informative toward subject.
An okay professor that expects a little too much of his students right off the bat. His teaching style is alright but the projects are a fair amount of work. His pace is quick.
The class is easy at the beginning, but gets tougher along the way. The professors seemed to explain stuff like they were easy, but sometimes they weren't. Make use of the TA office hours for HW, but you have to understand the concepts on your own. Pros: there is a lot of extra credit. Cons: Strict grading and you have to solve problems their way.
He is a good teacher for the most part. I feel like his attitude towards students has changed from what people have previously posted. The class started off very easy but ended up getting very difficult. Keep up with lecture in your homework!
He definitely knows what he is talking about. He explains things pretty clearly. The only problem was the he is kind of a jerk to students to have a "dumb" question, or one that he deems stupid. He can be a real jerk sometimes, but he is good at teaching aside from that major drawback.
Class covers a lot of different material. Depending on your background it may be extremeley easy, hard, or in the middle (in my case). Reading the book is essential for most. The tests and hwk are somewhat hard, but there is a lot of opportunity for extra credit. He also has lots of office hours and encourages visits. Overall very good prof.
Professor Yew can best be described as fine. Lectures just consist of him reading off his slideshow, with little added content. The homework and labs were pretty easy if you looked at his lecture notes and the textbook to guide you. Midterms were mostly made up of really easy problems with a few unexpected questions sprinkled in. Easy B, Hard A
The class wasn't that difficult, you just have to teach yourself everything. Lectures are just PowerPoint presentations. Exams were based off problems from the textbook and the Verilog programming assignments were straightforward and didn't require prior knowledge of Verilog. This class has some overlap with the topics introduced in CSCI2021.
I honestly didnt think he was that bad, and he certainly didnt have such a heavy accent. However Youll likely have to teach a lot of material to yourself. Be sure to understand the homeworks. If youre on the CSCI section of this course learn Verilog before since the EE/CompE students have learned it before. lass is curved so unclear grading
Prof. Yew is not the most accessible or understandable professor you'll have - but he knows his stuff. You'll need to do the reading to do well in this class, but midterms and quizzes have no surprises. Labs are tough but rewarding, if you get started early they're not a problem. Grades initially are awful, but the curve is very generous.
Fair instructor for this course. He expects people to put in the work as expressed in the 1st class. You must read the book! do all practice problems! be ready for lecture with material read! otherwise you'll be playing catchup the entire semester. Goes onto next material before testing. His teaching style is with power points.
Not as bad as other people are saying, especially for 2021. Yes the lectures and labs aren't original, but other professors won't be any different for such a universal course. Labs and tests are hard and require quite a significant amount of time, but the class is curved at the end. Textbook is absolutely required, huge help.
AMAZING professor. Easy to understand. Labs are pretty easy with exception of the Architecture Lab. Don't go the lectures--they're a waste of time if the class is too early in the morning for you.
The course was led by the textbook we used so the old slides and some of the labs were provided by the authors of the textbook. Overall, he doesn't want to "spoon feed" his student but rather they learn by themselves. The questions I had were answered well by him and the very helpful TA Andy
I never have trouble understanding professors' accents, but this was a real challenge and he mumbles! When asked questions during lecture, he doesn't understand what's being asked so most people just gave up. Tests cover WAY more than he ever did in lecture or readings. BAD prof but he's a big deal at the U so don't badmouth him to other profs.
Had Tian for Operating Systems and it was definitely the easiest computer science course of my entire career at the university. TAs were awful and late with everything, but really not the professor's fault. Strong and hard to understand accent, but when you can understand it, he's an enthusiastic guy with a passion for what he does. Not bad at all.
He's very enthusiastic about his subject and is fun to interact with in class. Sometimes he can be hard to understand because of his accent.
Not a bad teacher. Takes the time to explain examples very well in class. Class examples however are very simple compared to homework problems. As far as homework goes it's hard, requires Matlab which isn't taught in class, and you can only figure out about half of it from lectures and the book. Test are easier, fairer, and so is final grading.
Good lecturer, but exam is not well designed. This is a machine learning course not a calculus course, but he put most questions at asking you to derive maximum likelihood estimator and 0 question about testing students' abilities of understanding and explaining machine learning concepts.
this class was unlike any csci class iv seen. you know the material. you have done very well on the homework. you read the book and go to office hours and still some how get 50% on midterm and final. TAs would cut most points off for techincalities like descriptions of algorithms. avrage of the class was 65% which is a c+ . try to avoid.
I found his slides (pretty much taken out of the book) less confusing than his lectures (he rambled and was clearly not prepared). Problem sets were unreasonably long, and the tests were poorly written (basically boiled down to whether you had algorithm X written on your cheat sheet). Take algorithms with Carl and save yourself the headache.
I've had Baylor in the past (I believe he's no longer at the U) and enjoyed him both times. He's an engaging lecturer, even if things are rather all over the place. You do end up teaching yourself a bit, but the posted slides help greatly. The assignments were reasonable and so was the grading. He's unorganized and quite passive aggressive, however
Baylor isn't the best professor when it comes to making sure students understand the subject matter. Many students like him because he is a funny, easy going guy, but I wish he took a more structured approach to his lectures and way of teaching the material.
Students enjoy Wetzel because he is highly informal and tells a lot of jokes, but I wish that he took a more systematic approach to the material. I found that I had to teach essentially had to teach myself a lot of the time because the lessons were so loose.
Pretty fun and interesting projects. Class is nice if you are new to CSCI and programming, but if are aren't new, it can be a very long and tedious process, but only quizzes and labs require attendance
Decent teacher but not great at explaining concepts to beginners-instead of reinforcing concepts in various ways, he makes people feel bad for not understanding. Class is graded ridiculously harshly, penalized for small mistakes. Blames bad test grades on student inability and procrastination, when he should be looking at grading policy & himself.
I felt as if I had learned a lot, passing lab each week, even though I was failing both the quizzes and exams. Exams were impossible and you don't get credit for doing the correct work. If you don't get it exactly as they have specified you will get 13% (lol) , so yeah I failed the class and have to take it again. Overall a really horrible class.
Jensen is nice, but this class can be pretty stressful because so much of your grade is based on weekly quizzes that can pull material from labs, exercises, or readings. The readings are mostly worthless (you're better off just learning by doing), but he occasionally uses material from them to deflate quiz grades. The core material isn't that hard.
Lectures are optional, labs are mandatory (you can miss/fail two though). Homework assignments are somewhat trivial if you attend lectures and do the pre-reads (online, no physical textbook). Mid terms are simple and somewhat easy if you utilize the allowed-to-use one sheet of paper you can bring into the exams.
He's got a fun sense of humor and describes concepts very well from using simple examples, analogies, and historical connections to simplify and explain complex concepts.
Makes lectures fun and interesting. Very sarcastic so if he calls you out on something don't take it personally. Available to answer questions during office hours but will not help with homework assignments. TAs have a lot of different hours to help with homework and other questions. Tests can be tough but they are doable if you study.
He is a clear instructor, but reading textbook prior to class can boost your understanding exponentially. His lecture is hilarious and enjoyable. His labs are mandatory, and they are good chances to review materials. If you skipped, you will struggle a lot unless you are a genius. However, he does not discuss homework with you. You need to go TAs.
I didn't have any prior programming experience, and I found that this class really helped me learn a lot. At the beginning, it felt like everyone else in the class had a lot more programming experience, but I was quickly caught up to speed with everyone else. The homework is really tough, but the tests were manageable.
I enjoyed the content of the course and his pedagogy. He was often a bit of a jokester, however sometimes it was at the expense of embarrassing students (e.g. when one kid said he had completed an assignment the day after it was assigned and he basically said the kid had no life which led to the entire class laughing to his embarrassment).
This course can be extremely difficult if you have no background in computer programming. At first, the class seems like a breeze, but it got really hard really fast. Labs are 4 hours long and usually require an additional 2-4 hours outside of class. Jensen is a good teacher in lecture, but the labs are much harder than the material he teaches.
Not the most exciting person to listen to but I mean it could have been worse. He knows his stuff and is passionate about what he does.
Pretty clear lecturer. Lectures were boring, but not confusing. Clearly defines expectations for class. I would attribute my barely-passing grade to not attending class often enough. Tests were difficult though, especially the final. They focused on theory and proofs. Doable but challenging class. And I think I would recommend Gary for this class.
Very passionate, very helpful to students, interesting research. He has the makings of a great professor but is new at it and so currently (Fall 2015) his lectures aren't very coherent and substantive often.
Professor Dasuki is helpful and easy, but not very clear (he mumbles a lot.) He deserves the chili peppers - he's a solid 7/10 (would be 8/10 if 5'10" and 10/10 if 6'2".)
Class attendance recorded via simple daily quizzes on assigned lecture videos were the majority of the grade. The mobile app project the class revolves around was very doable even without android experience. Do the work and you'll get an A.
you do need to be really good at 3D math to survive. got 99/100 for 2033 and still was frustrated and lost half the time. lecture pace is fast, don't be surprised if you are lost. he gave many hints for assignments, so it's possible to finish them. tests are a bit rough. overall the content is interesting, but I feel like I didn't learn much.
I had him his first semester teaching and overall I think he did a pretty decent job. The beginning was really tough because he seemed to expect us to know a lot more than we did but it got better as the class went on. Homeworks can be pretty tough but the labs help out a lot if you learn how to do them.
I took CSCI 1933 in the summer in part because I heard mixed things about Dovolis. Polzin isn't the best professor out there but he more or less teaches you enough for the material you need to work on. He's not exactly affable (that might've just been due to online teaching), but what he lacks in personality he makes up for in brevity and clarity.
Retakes are much harder than the original exams like why? It doesn't make any sense and it just confuses people I know it's a technical/problem solving course but still, sorry but the retakes really affected my grade & even with studying the materials and lectures he posted, he decides to confuse people on the retake for no reason what's the point
Prof Knights was able to explain the difficult content of the class fairly well. Fair warning though, the homework assignments can be really long and intensive if you're not a CSCI major. I think Prof Knights would have been better during a normal (non virtual) semester. He was not very accommodating and often came off as rude.
Dan is an awesome professor. His lectures and quick and most of the time you won't understand what he's talking about until you read the book. But if you ask questions he is more than willing to help you out. TA's were terrible, so double check all of the grading and if you have questions, go directly to Dan. Do all practice problems.
Not sure why Travis has such bad reviews. Sure he's a little disorganized and the class got off to a slow start, but he's a really genuine guy and seems to really care about the class and the subject matter. Grading really hasn't been that tough either, it's not a super hard class so far. His lectures are short and the textbook is awful though.
Lectures are near useless for the homeworks because of the high level of abstraction and math, rather than teaching students how to apply it, project is insanely difficult with high expectations, students are expected to already have mastered deep learning frameworks to even start. Park is obviously intelligent but often comes off as condescending.
Prof Park provided great lectures and assignments. The materials are well organized. Two things may be improved: 1. The slides are not very efficient. TOO many visualizations sometimes made us lose track of the key idea. 2. The expectation of the project is ridiculously high. You are required to beat a paper published in the last 3 years.....
Park is rather quiet when lecturing, although he does a decent job. There is optional homework, and 3 mandatory projects (1 is dropped). There are 7 quizzes and 3 midterms, each of which ask fair questions as long as you pay attention. The final is also fair, and a cheat sheet is allowed on each test. Gotta practice and use the textbook, though.
2011 was harder than it should've been. I found myself bored in lecture and relied on the book for better understanding & practice. Homeworks were graded a bit harsh and at times were incredibly hard for no reason. TAs couldn't help much on the homeworks due to him not having the answer keys. Exams were open note & not too difficult of problems.
I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviewer. It's unfortunate because there is a lot of very interesting material but it's integrated in the most uncreative way possible for a course such as this one. Exams and essays are also not trivial and there is a substantial amount of busy work. Take advantage of extra credit if you want an A.
Professor Barry gave boring lectures that were hard to follow and honestly you're probably better off just reading the book and not attending lectures. Homework was graded very harshly but the weekly quizzes were pretty easy. The first half of this class was hard and annoying but it gets better.
I liked this class. I think you'll dislike it if you don't enjoy reading, writing, or history. Barry picked good topics and the class was well-structured. I agree with the other commenter. I watched Barry on 2x speed and I would struggle with staying attentive if it were in person. There was lots of opportunity for gimme points and extra credit.
Prof. Barry is the reason that that 2x speed button was invented. Decent lectures, but very (very) slow. This wasn't a big deal because i could just speed up the video, but I'm not sure I'd want to take an in person class with him. The content of the course is pretty boring, but that's not really the fault of the professor. Lots of busy work.
This professor has been given some very interesting and varied content for this class. The method of engaging with the content, however, is exhausingly boring. Discussing ethical and philosophical ideas with classmates has been reduced to a text crawl of soundbytes thanks to overuse of a platform called menti. Be prepared for some boring lectures.
Barry is a nice person but he grades harshly. He gave about an 80% avg grade in my course which is a B-. He seems to think that these are good grades but I think a lot of people were surprised and frustrated. If you want an easy A don't take him. Also, the course content was eh.
Professor is quite fair. He drops one midterm, one hw, and two in class exercises, which is great. Hw is rather hard and time consuming but you need to know how to do it for the tests. Lectures are pretty dull, and I hated in class exercises. Stopped attending and started just teaching myself. But i did review lectures online Take him if you can
Not a bad instructor, but I found his lectures to become stale throughout the semester. He often puts an example on the board and waits a minute or two for the class to complete it, even if it is something he had just introduced. I found this to become very annoying and eventually lost all focus in class. Other than that, his exams are very fair.
Dr. Barry is honestly not great at presenting material. His lectures can seem disorganized and confusing. But he's good at answering questions and his home works and exams are reasonable. Get ready to take notes though. He tests on material not in the books, but doesn't post notes online.
Homeworks are once a week. The exams are mostly based on the homework problems, so study those. As for the professor, he isnt bad at what he does, he follows his schedule and teaches through examples for each section. Requires you come to class at least once a week to "participate" in a in class assignment. You can miss class as long as you study.
CLEAR PPT! His lecture are dull/long reading directly off PPT but require attendance. (Hard to stay focused) Heavy load project assignments. Helpful at teaching writing assignments. Pretty FAIR exams. Not hard to get a good grade but depending on your team. (Chosen by TAs). Very approachable and friendly. Course itself is related to industry a lot.
Analysis of Numerical Algorithms is a tough class in general. He provides some guidance but the class is geared for those with a previous in-depth understanding.

Didnt really enjoy the class, he was rather boring. One thing he's good at is posting notes and such on the class web site.
Took 4211 & 5221 with him, and the materials are okay as long as you read the things and do it. Exams & homework are tricky, but pretty flexible about the assignments I suppose.
I don't know what he is talking about. I was thinking that he was going to explain some useful stuff. He is intended to explain his area not the basics of the course. I really don't like his lessons. By the way, the assignments are so tough and I spent most of my time to his assignment knowing that I will never use them again
I liked the course after taking it. He did a lot of Matlab examples in class and that really helped as I used it for all my homeworks. His exams were quite difficult and most people in the class often ran out of time. Average-above average instructional abilities.
Tough class for most but Jon is a good guy. His lectures are a little scatterbrained and he could use some slide reorganization. Exams are HARD but not worth as much as projects, make sure you get good groups for those and take advantage of ability to switch them if necessary. Quizzes and labs are easy. You get a lot of drops.
Grading was generous but the class was by far the hardest I've had to take in the major. The group projects were quite long and difficult and stressful to debug. The material is hard as Unix feels very unintuitive, and Jon's lectures did alright at breaking things down but were fairly minimal and expected us to fill in the gaps.
Hard class. Not a bad professor by any means but I personally really disliked the format that he taught in (i.e. having prerecorded lectures before the synchronous time) and it ruined the class for me. Look for good group members, however, don't give a group member all the control of the projects. I feel like I didn't learn as much as a result.
Tough class with tough material and a ton of work. I usually fell asleep in his lectures because they were kind of boring and he dimmed the lights, so I stopped going and was able to teach myself everything. Make sure you get good group members for your projects
Dr. Redish is very knowledgable! His concepts are very difficult in the class, but he constantly is asking students if they have questions or understand the material. Plus, he really encourages students hours. Overall, it's a difficult class and he is a tough grader, but all the exams and homeworks are open note making them much easier!
He's a pretty good lecturer but with the class being 2.5 hrs long its kind of hard to pay attention completely. grade is made up of 3 labs and 1 final which can be pretty easy if you have decent coding background otherwise youre in for a wild ride. He's willing to help but takes a while to respond to emails (he warns you of this). Otherwise 6/10
Definitely helped to already know C going into this. The projects weren't too difficult but could be time consuming. Final was hard because it was completely theory based and no coding. Going to lectures helped because that is where he explained all the theory stuff you needed for the final.
It's a really easy class if you know C, perl, or shell scripting. If not, you go super slow. The final was pretty challenging as it wasn't coding questions, but more how the languages work like character vs pointer array stuff. Advantages of disadvantages of interpreted and compiled code, etc. He also doesn't respond to emails very fast, if at all.
Overall good lecturer- is funny and odd, but in a good way. Occasionally I couldn't help but feel mathematically outclassed, but the most important topics were often explained in thorough detail. Show up for class, pay attention, and his homeworks are doable. We had no actual examinations He only wants his students to learn, grading reflects that.
Pretty good. The class was based on interesting coding assignments and relatively easy open-book tests. His lectures were a bit boring though, and so I didn't go to many. Still did fine in the class. You're supposed to find a partner for the coding assignments, but sometimes it can be tough to find a good one. They were easy enough to do alone.
My impression is that Chandra's 4061 offering is easier than the others (Weissman, Tripathi etc.). Some students had overall grades above 100% due to extra credit. The labs weren't as bad as I expected, and the exams were surprisingly simple. Chandra's lectures were clear, but sometimes so general that I felt like I wasn't actually learning much.
His lectures are fairly slow and boring, he's not a bad professor by any means and explained things well and pretty intuitively but I preferred reading the textbook for this class, which he co-wrote. The book was quite helpful and fairly easy to read. He also had us use slido for in-class participation and I didn't find it worthwhile.
Kumar is a great professor, but this course is terrible. It is not hard but lots of ambiguity. Besides, there are too much things you need to remember. It is an English and statistic course instead of a csci course. Lecture is interesting but sometimes is useless. Think well before you take this course.
This course is so difficult to deal with. There are so many assignments and It takes so much time. I would not take this course if I knew that.
Lectures can be dry and unrelated to actual material, but the class wasn't too hard to do by yourself. The tests can be somewhat hard if you aren't prepared.
Honestly she is very and passionate about computer science. She tries to make the class as hard as possible for you while making it seem like what she is doing isn't that difficult. Makes and introductory class to comp. sci harder than it needs to be, and nearly scares kids away because of so. Sign up for the other professor, she nearly ruined it
She is OBSESSED with pokemon. It was funny at first, then it just got weird. The class overall is easy. If you attend most lectures and read the textbook, you'll be fine.
Lana is very nice and very helpful. Her lectures are interesting and informative. The class is based around a semester long group project where you work together to design and create an app. A good amount of reading is required. She often has pop quizzes after a reading, so make sure you remember the names of the terms in what you read.
It is clear that Sattar cares about teaching, he does a good job making sure his lectures are engaging! My only complaint is that sometimes he can get easily side tracked. His teaching can sometimes be all over the place, which makes it hard to follow (especially as someone who was new to coding).
Junaed is a nice enough guy, though the lectures are often slow and mostly pointless. You will likely end up teaching yourself most course content, which is not difficult since everything is introductory and easily found online. In his office hours, however, Professor Sattar is very helpful and easily reached outside of class.
Respected
lectures were boring but IMPORTANT! The exams are based off the lecture notes so take good notes. only 3-4 questions on exam. Also go to office hours early for projects and homework because there is not a lot of TA's.
He gave little to no resources. Nothing was uploaded online besides a few lecture codes. Lectures sometimes messy. Exams were reasonable, but given the amt of content & no assistance, it felt like we went in blind. You're fine if you're good at coding. Grading was slow, unorganized, and a bit harsh. Moen is nice, caring, & helpful outside lectures.
Moen only assigned three homework assignments across the entire semester, which was not ideal, as you were graded on that, two midterms, and a final, so good luck if you messed one thing up. However, his lectures are entertaining. He doesn't seem well prepared for class, but made it work somehow. Not super in-depth info wise.
It's a boring class and I feel like I haven't learned anything. Class isn't difficult, very few assignments. Seems like he puts in very little work.
Moen is alright. He dumbs down every lecture so that pretty much everyone understands, but that's about it. Just scratches the surface of every topic, nothing more. As always, the grading takes forever and 95% for an A leaves very little margin for error.
Beware of getting caught in the purgatory that is Moen courses. He's an incredibly funny guy, but when it comes to your actual learning, don't expect to feel challenged or engaged. Moen is the perfect intro lecturer. Easy-going and articulate. However, in harder courses, he doesn't care for engaging students with expanding the deeper concepts.
Like a dude said before, the good thing: he doesn't care, and the bad thing: he doesn't care. A tough grader, If you have chance,choos another prof,or you will need 95% to get an A Grading TA also doesn't care either, and his policy is "talk to grading TA, not me" Lecture shows his caring, but even in pandamic, 95% rule doesn't change
Lectures are easy to understand w/ excellent examples. Homeworks aren't difficult. Difficulty usually stem from lack of clarity on assignments. JM is nice, willing to explain things, but does the bare minimum. Lazy, imo. Mgmt of TAs was pretty bad this semester. Had no idea how we did on first two HW's before first exam. Slow grading and feedback.
Moen seems like a decent guy but his class was just chaotic. With no textbook and only his scattered (and often incorrect) scribbles on the board, prep for exams was close to impossible. He covered tons of material that wasnt in the scope of the course and then tested on the material that was in the scope but not really a focus of lecture.
The good: Moen doesn't care The bad: Moen doesn't care. He lectures well other than him making a mistake every 10 minutes. His grading system is awful and an A is a 95%. What makes his grading system even worse is that his keys are consistently wrong and you have to battle hard for points back. Lowkey funny but also lowkey shouldn't have a job
Moen would often end lecture early by 10-15 minutes. This may or may not be good depending on what you want to take away from this course. If you are looking to learn Algorithms and Data Structures in depth, consider taking different professor. There was little to no work week to week and the lectures were typically straightforward but boring.
I took CSCI2041 (functional programming with closure) with professor Moen. His lectures were generally good, and he has an interesting sense of humor. Grading was done entirely by TAs, so you don't know what you're going to get there. Because the course had no textbook, lectures were important (and posted online), and tests were open-note.
Moen is one of my favorite CSCI professors. Homework is fairly easy and doable, and relevant for preparation for exams. As long as you attend & pay attention in lecture and take good notes, you'll be good for the exam since they are open notes. He provides many examples, step-by-step to make sure that everyone understands. Would take again!
Moen is an overall great guy. 4041 lectures can become sort of long and we did a lot of review so the beginning of class was fairly easy. Beware he doesn't communicate with the TA's real well so don't expect to get your hw back real quick. Overall the class has some interesting concepts and moen does a good job presenting them.
Really good instructor, sometimes pretty funny. Labs and homework are workable, and tests are about the basic. You can get a good grade if you know the materials well.
Prof Moen is a funny guy. I want to like him, but I have to say, he did not prepare the students well for the exams, partly because he didn't write them until the last minute. Labs were SUPER easy. He was ok at explaining things. The class was easy for me because coding comes easy to me. I felt bad for other students who struggled.
Professor McCamant is really disorganized, but he takes student feedback seriously and made fair tests and homework assignments in my opinion. The lectures can be really dry though, and I could not for the life of me stay awake in lecture both before and after Covid. Regardless, I got an A by reading the book and asking for help when needed.
McCamant knows his stuff, there's no question there. His lectures are a tad dry, but so is computer architecture! He genuinely wants to see those that work hard pass the class, but he also doesn't cut corners, which I respect. My biggest peeve was slow grading and unclear homework dates. Often things in the lab wouldn't work, but I blame the TAs.
He seems like a fine prof but 2021 is the worst class ever. An adviser said no one should take 2021 at the U if they can help it because it is "unnecessarily difficult". I'm certainly not the smartest student, but I'm not the worst either and I had to drop the course because it was far too much work for just 4 credits.
This class is serious. Lots of reading. Challenging Homework. Hard exams. I have never been so stressed, or kept my eye on the drop date so closely. I was just asked what my favorite course so far has been, I answered "5271". Syllibi, past assignments and reading lists are easily found online to get an idea of what to expect.
Pretty boring lecture but personally the class isn't hard if you put the time in. Beware of his final being 25% content he covers on one slide or less. Just print off every slide if possible for the final. Not a hard class to slide by though imo
Hard class, hard homework
We had a hacking assignment (tough), written homework (medium difficulty), and group research project (tough) going on at the same time. The homeworks are brutal and the exam was tough too. The class is not curved even though the exam average was 50%. Interesting class, but prepare to spend all your time on it.
Homework is brutal, and he sets high expectations for the course project material. Loads of readings (1-2 papers or textbook chapters per lecture), but you can get away with skimming them. Beware, though just learning the material isn't enough deep understanding is a must.
Too much homework, Super hard test.
entertaining guy, really rough HW and tests
Gives clear grading criteria from the start and curves the tests. Questions on the first mid term were much more difficult then homework.
The prof seemed to go for depth over breadth on material. Keep that in mind. Grounds very abstract topics easily and works in examples on proofs in lecture. Lecture is worth a listen imo. Homework is graded harshly. Exams are VERY difficult i.e, double-digit number of proofs in 1-2 hours. Do many proofs, many times, or you will struggle to pass.
He is actually quite knowledgable with what he has in his mind and his logic is fast but the stuff we have to learn in 2011 just made me sick of the whole thing. I bet he's better teaching other courses than this one.
He means well, but the course has been confusing. It's hard to make sense of what is needed for each assignment
Good lectures, teaches you a lot about SWE, but the subject is inherently vague and difficult, and the structure of the class does not help with it either. Need to do a lot to get an A, and never miss anything they hide somewhere in some "optional" document. 40 pages of writing half a semester never given much instructions on the assignment itself
CSCI 3081W was a project based course and the majority of the work was towards that. It is hard to rate Kevin as a professor as the lectures were more discussions about this project rather than learning material. However, he seemed like a caring guy overall. He would throw new requirements at us last minute though. Horrible course, okay professor.
The first 1/2 of the semester was just a crash course in C++ which was great until the workload tripled at the end of October after releasing the final project. Poorly structured course, vague project requirements, unhelpful lectures. He was really nice about helping me out when I got behind though. You have to be proactive in his class to succeed.
Lecture is not mandatory, but necessary to succeed. Slides are posted online, but most information presented is not on the slides. Rubrics are very clear and specific, follow them to the letter
Kevin was a great teacher - I learned the concepts really well and truly enjoyed his teaching style. That being said, I took this class F'15 in his first semester and it showed. The second test was almost impossible in the time allotted because he tested it on TA's who had tried it once before. Made an open accusation of cheating against the class.
Lectures were often confusing, but he does a good job of offering help outside of lecture. Homework assignments themselves weren't too difficult, but often poorly worded, which often led to confusion. Tests were difficult and problems often included complicated logic.
Kevin was a decent lecturer, however, many times he would speak of topics that had yet to be covered in lecture. He is a tough grader, the weekly homework assignments are tough, and the labs are tough but effective for learning. The tests, particularly the second test and the final, are very difficult but he does curve them.
I had no previous coding experience. I honestly think he's a pretty good teacher. Cares about his students, he set aside a whole class to hear concerns regarding a hard test. Btw, students were complaining about the test being two sided because it was "hard to flip the page to read what was on the other side". Just to give some perspective.
Prof. Tripathi was a fair professor. His lectures were very dry at times (i.e. death by PowerPoint), however, his class delivered on teaching material to students which is ultimately what I paid $$$ for, overall, I learned a lot. Be sure you comfortable with C programming. On a personal level, he's meh. Condescending towards students.
His lectures are extremely boring. The projects are (for the most part) easy to do and the bulk of your grade is based on that.
His lectures are deadly boring, but grading is mostly centered around labs (not exams), and you learn a lot by doing them. He's also incredibly generous about extensions.
If you're not a pure CS major, this course and instructor are very challenging. He wants to help and wants everyone to succeed. Homework assignments are extremely challenging.

Kind of a pretty boring online lecture where she writes on a notepad. This is an intro to AI class, but feels like it was made in the 1650s. Get this class if you want an easier low stress class, but don't expect to be engaged or blown away. Most poeple are going to need more time on exams.
For the most part she was ok, but I did learn more from the textbook. The writing section of the class was more towards the first half of the semester, with the latter half focused on the final project and a paper. Not too bad of a class, I understand why people do have complaints though.
Good professor for the most part. There is a lot of content that is not brought up in lectures at all (only in textbook). Many students (myself included) found midterms to not have enough time for completion (like an HW assignment with an exam's time). The content was relatively interesting, though. Some grading was fairly harsh.
This course was a repeat of csci discrete math. With feedback, Gini's not the best. She took points away on final project w/o explaining why. Avg on project was 78% (no curve). She only graded the writing btw (when there were more to the project)! Sucks when your team put in a lot only to receive a harsh grade because writing isn't your best asset!
Reputed American mathematician who doesnt know how to teach a lower level python class.
Professor Gini can be difficult to understand at times (especially when she doesn't use the lapel mic), but she is passionate about her class and is willing to help you if there's something you're having trouble with. She's a lenient grader, and gives you tons of feedback in the form of in-class assignments that are essentially free points.
Professor Gini showed up to all the lab sections during the first week to make sure students were 'fitting in'. this of course is unusual and earned her much of my respect. lectures are too slow and exams are a bit hard but the grading is very kind. mistakes are often made in lectures but she posts class notes (correct code) which are very helpful.
Dan is a nice guy that cares about his students, but doesn't give the greatest lectures. Lectures are monotone and extremely theory- and math-heavy, and applications are left to the (long) homework assignments. Prepare to read the textbook after going to lecture. That said, the grading is fairly easy on homework and tests if you put in the effort.
Really smart guy, and he kept lectures enjoyable - even if some of the material wasn't always conveyed the best. Homework significantly more difficult than the tests, which were fairly easy, and pop quizzes are attendance checks.
He's a bit confusing in lecture, but the tests are fair. If you do the homework you'll have no problem with the testquiz material.
Great guy, great class. Would take again
Dr. Boley knows the material well, and the subject is pretty interesting. Just pay attention in class and everything should go well. His tests are very fair.
I took an entry level course in CSci with him but he's clearly accustomed to teaching upper echelon courses. He used terminology with which the class was not familiar. He had no set lesson plan for the class and as a result he often glazed over important topics or just forgot them making the lectures seem disjointed. Exams were easy though.
Was forced to take this class after transfering here - this class is absolutely worthless by the way, a typical 'freshman filter' course. Dr. Boley is a smart guy, if not very eloquently spoken.
I'm taking her class right now. I never wear seatbelt while driving to the U because I wanted to die before making it to her class. She does everything on her whiteboard so you need to be in the class if u wanna learn anything. Anyways, have a good semester. I know I won't. Tests are like 85% and homeworks are straight out of the textbook.
Overall an okay experience. Pros: adjusted the grading scale/structure when most of us were not doing well. Kind, light-hearted, gives a 5-minute break during lecture. Cons: Big focus on textbook. Only 1 example (or 2) per topic walked through in lecture. Inconsistent syntax quirks. Weekly assignments are difficult, and to get 30/30 is unrealistic.
Solid professor. No notes or slides posted from lecture, writes everything out on board. Weekly programming assignments in Python and written math assignments. Quizzes every other week in discussion worth 60% of the grade in total. The class is dif
Kathryn Jensen is a good lecturer, but her lectures aren't enough to make 2011 better. Her TAs are almost always only available during class time, and for some reason the TAs aren't even allowed to help students on their homework.
Professor Gopalan is pretty average and quite generous with passing people (class avg. was around 80%, but 55% was passing). HW is challenging, but usually very relevant to lectures. Exams are hard, but he provides a comprehensive mock exam. Difficulty of the course is really related to how well you pick up functional programming concepts.
Honestly I think he's a bit underrated here; his lectures can be a bit boring and at too high of a level sometimes, but I feel like he's a pretty average professor; does what he needs to do, explains principles well enough. Most of the learning takes place on your own when working on the HW, but that should be expected for pretty much any CS class.
Gop certainly cares about the subject and his students, but does a questionable job at connecting his understanding to the students. The content covered is difficult in its own right, but he doesn't communicate the core concepts concisely, and passes over nuances. Don't take the labs or homework for granted, they are essential in learning material

Classes are not super interesting and sometimes can be boring. You have to go to lectures for in class exercises but you can miss a few of them. Homework can be hard and very time-consuming. Programming homework has almost no partial credit - you either get 30% for submitting something or 100% for passing all tests. Quizzes are not too hard.
Labs were always given just 10 hours before they were due, whereas in other sections, labs would generally be given a week before they were due. With this time-crunch style lab model, the grade you receive for your labs reflects not one's true understanding of the course content, but more so one's ability to pick up content quickly and immediately.
Other than the first test being unreasonably difficult, I think this class was okay. I didn't enjoy it but my grade isn't terrible. Prof. Exley taught the material well but he often didn't cover what we actually were tested on in detail. Sometimes the quiz would come up and I would be so lost despite attending all lectures. Okay Professor.
I attended a grand total of 1 lecture, and the textbook was good enough to learn all of the content from otherwise. The grading in this class makes it very easy, just do the homework and show up to the labs to pass, the quizzes/bookwork are worth almost nothing in your final grade.
Very poor performance with making sure the assignments have been written clearly and correctly. Will often post lectures late. The lectures that are provided online are hard to learn from. Basically have to attend class to learn. Could teach better. Is often clearly caffeinated. Nice person though
Likely won't pass the course if you don't attend lecture. HOWEVER, if you DO attend, you will likely do well in the course. Willing to be that the vast majority of students who complain about her did not spend time in her lectures or were not actually listening. If she is your only option, you will be fine, just get ready to work.
VERY accommodating for deadlines on projects bc those were INSANELY hard. she's always willing to help. her lectures were hard to listen to. the labs and HW are doable. Hard to get help on class topics from anyone besides the teacher bc it differs in detail compared to other 2021 classes. It's not a terrible class but youre in for a wild ride.
Her classes are mostly research oriented and not very helpful. She never replies to emails and expects students to reach the TA instead. Her slides were mostly copy-paste of slides from other professors in various universities. It looked like she put very little effort and plan to teach a class.
The programming assignment and project is extremely tough and there is no smooth transition from simple assignment to big project
Very difficult class. If you pay attention at every lecture and ask for help when you get confused it is managable. If you get behind you will be in trouble. This is an intense class and it is likely the material, not her that cause problems.
Prof Zhai's lectures could be a lot better if she didn't stutter as much and spoke with more confidence. Often times there are inconsistencies between sentences, and one has to pay hard attention to grasp the message. However, she is extremely helpful in office hours. So do go to them.
Ravi is tough, but he's not one of those profs who considers teaching to be a secondary responsibility. He's good at explaining most of the material. But his is the hardest 2011 section. Tutors often can't answer his HW probs. Even his TA's sometimes can't. He focused on proofs, but skipped graphs and trees (what you actually use in CS).
Janardan is a good lecturer. Not particularly inspirational, but he manages to present material in a way that that is clear and doesn't put one to sleep, even in 2.5 hour night lecture. Most all necessary material is covered in lecture, so if you take good notes, you should be fine. Beware, homework and test grading leaves you at the mercy of TAs.
Easy homework and fair curve if the ave quiz grade is low. Can drop at least two quizzes.
Pretty good. Hard to hear in a large room.
Class is easy with lots of opportunities to redo stuff. Lectures are boring and often cover material that will not be tested on. Favonia is awkward but caring and funny
This class is very easy. He gave two redo attempts for each homework and you could replace midterm grades with the final, so I didn't have to take the final. He clearly has some work to do surrounding interaction with students. He never said anything rude to me but had to send out apologies throughout the semester for comments during lecture.
Favonia is my fav prof yet since Nathan Taylor. Multiple chances to redo HW thus opportunities to truly learn material, midterm & final grade weights are very fair. Labs are really useful. Lectures could be more helpful, TA's were pretty unhelpful. He's kinda funny too. Favonia definitely cares that you learn the material and you will.
Will gladly tell you that you are wrong, but won't provide any explanation as to why. Nice guy, below average instructor.
The only problem he has was difficulty communicating and explaining. The homework is quite interesting and the midterms are not too hard. Most students have trouble understanding the grading method, hope it be will improve.
Took it in the Fall 2021 semester, I gotta say that the grading was a little weird. The professor was very nice and explained things if you asked. The grading at the end seemed rushed and it was like they just put a score on everything. Not much instruction on what the project was supposed to be like, just some examples. Got lucky and did good tho.
He's obviously a very intelligent and experienced guy, but I didn't really get anything out of this class. I think this is more due to the class material than him personally though. This class was called "Practice of DB Systems", but besides a few weeks on SQL and indexes, it was just useless theory. They really need to redesign this course.
This was a fast-paced class where we had to read two to three papers before each class. I liked that we were able to ask questions about the papers prior to class and then he answers during class. Overall, responsive and knowledgeable. You WILL work in this class.

I loved the class, and the online videos greatly improved my grade, which helped considering my focus and memory struggles. I recommend taking his class but be ready for hard work. Unfortunately, he's strict; when a family issue arose, he didn't consider it a valid reason for an extension, even when I offered to give him documentation.
Now I wouldn't say that Kolb is the best professor out there, but he is also not a bad one. Class is structured very similarly to the rest of the courses required before this one. Lectures are hard to understand because they cover so much in a short time. If you relied on TA office hours, good luck getting help, there are too many students.
I respect the fact that he only had 7 assignments throughout the semester and a midterm and final that really were not super hard. The deal is this is a really important class with core concepts of CS as a whole, and he's just too theoretical and proofy for things that dont have to be that deep, like man relax, youre at the U not oxford.
I can tell that Carl is really knowledgeable and smart, but I struggled in class due to the nature of how theoretical the lectures were. In addition, the quizzes took WEEKS to grade. It wasn't until the last three weeks of the semester that quizzes 5-10 were graded (the number might be wrong--but roughly around there).
Carl is unlike other profs. Very lightweight class (no assignments) only graded on weekly quizzes and final exam. Lectures are pretty dense, but most of the material is fluff or far too in depth to show up on the quiz. Quizzes are pretty easy. If you follow lectures and do practice problems once in awhile, you'll get an A. Grade lines are 90/75/60
Carl's lectures are incredibly dense and hard to follow, but his weekly quizzes are very reasonable. If even half of what he says sticks, you'll do just fine. Read the textbook and do the practice questions and you might even be able to skip lecture.
Easy to pass, hard to get an A. Most of the grade is hw and sometimes are very difficult. Go to his office hours! He's happy to help. Tests are a bit easier than hws, since he believes that you do the most learning on the hw. He's teaches more theoretical-- if you love theory, definitely take his class! But as a person who doesn't, it's pain.
All of the homework is straight from the book. He gives a pdf of the book so you don't need to buy it. If you read the book, you don't need to watch the lectures. He's not a good lecturer and is hard to follow. But, he is very organized and fairly flexible. He's pretty kind and has a cool personality.
Very book heavy. He's not a good lecturer and is hard to follow. He is very organized and fairly flexible. He's pretty kind and has a cool personality.
Your grade is basically the final and homework. Be VERY thorough with homework. For online, I wrote 10+ pages in proofs every two weeks. Proof-heavy class, very little actual code. If you don't know basic discrete math proofs, and some linear algebra (matrix multiplication) you will have a tough time. You will learn concepts, not implementation.
Lectures were dry, very theory/concept based. Assignments from the textbook with no actual coding assignments, lectures/textbook used pseudocode, disgusting. Assignment every other week worth 8%, mistakes are costly. Grades are in 5% increments starting at 95 for an A, 90 for A- etc. He's very knowledgeable and kind, but I hated his way of teaching
He is a great lecturer; however this class is mostly a repeat of 4041. If you want to learn something new, just read whatever seems interesting in Cormen.
Your opinion of Sturtivant will likely be related solely to the subjects he teaches. Homework is optional but necessary for me at least to survive the weekly tests. Discussion was helpful as well in understanding the topics. He writes only on the board and is a bit of a droner, but knows a lot and cares about the courses.
Dr. Sturtivant knows the concepts he teaches very well. However, his teaching style is VERY abstract and theoretical. So, I often found myself reviewing my class notes and implementing stuff practically in an attempt to learn by myself. The assignments were fun, but the midterm and final were both quite difficult, unlike what he says about them.
Smart man, bad lectures (Not worth going if you haven't read ahead in the book). Grading/Criteria is done by undergrad TAs, which I personally was not a big fan of. The book is dry asf. Quizzes were relatively tough, but you get 2 drops which is pretty cool. Would recommend different professor if you wanted lectures to make sense.
Carl is a genius and does care about each of his students. With that said though, he teaches his classes at a very high level at a really fast speed. If this is going to be your hardest class of the semester, he is fine but otherwise I would take it with the other prof, bc I heard he breaks it down more for you + you're graded on more things!
A lot of what he says in class I found to be quite useless. If anything, I simply went over the book rather than go to class as the professor doesnt do any actual useful examples. He deals mainly with the theoretical, which isnt always necessarily helpful. My TA was simply not good. He'd hand us a worksheet and then tell us to figure it out ourself
11 undroppable quizes worth 5% of grade each and a final. Mess up a single addition on a quiz and there goes a whole 2% on your grade
2011 sucked because of the book. 2033 was amazing because of the book. The lectures are very theoretical but also interesting. Would've rated higher if the book for 2011 wasn't complete crap.
He's a little boring so I started only showing up for the quizzes about 2 weeks in and learned through YouTube (TheTrevTutor). Missed a true A by like half a question on the final. Take that as you will
The grade is entirely based on quizzes and the final: 55% of grade is 11 quizzes; drop two lowest. 37% of the grade is the final, and you get the remaining 8% for free. Carl's lectures can be dull and uninteresting--he doesn't teach with examples, so it's a whole lot of proofs and theory. However, his last lecture answered a question on the final.
I took Discrete Math (2011) from Prof. Sturtivant and loved his teaching style. However, after taking CSCI 5421 from him, I think he describes some processes much too abstractly. We spent two 2.5 hour lectures on some encryption concepts (with no examples) which I had previously learned from a twenty minute YouTube video (with examples).
I see that he's very highly rated by a lot of people. However,I didn't feel he was a good teacher at all. He teaches by explaining things by words and not by examples. I got an A in the course but that was because I read the book on my own. The exams are easy,but the cut off for A is 95 so the margin for error is also very less.
Carl's 2011 is the most difficult discrete structures class offered at the UMN. Take another professor if you want an easier version. High grade scale for the class, weekly quizzes, zero hw, zero extra credit, no midterms, and a final. It's helpful to take calc 2 and calc based statistics before taking this class (not required).
Learned so much from Carl's class, but I don't feel the same way as the other students here. He is extremely knowledgeable and articulate, but he speaks too much of his lecture when more demonstrative board use would be helpful. Complex material, and most of my learning came from the book. Get ready to be evaluated constantly (weekly quizzes).
My least favorite part of the class was the final. There is an unfair weight of 40% and even if you did well on the rest of the class, if you suck on the final it will hurt you. However, Sturtivant is an excellent professor. The thing is, if you go to lecture, you had to tunnel tunnel vision and pay utmost attention or you'll get lost immediately.
Fair teacher. Great guy when you get to know him.
The grade system doesn't make sense. You can pass the course w/o any effort if you do S/N, since HW answers can be easily searched online and HW are 65% of total grade where 60% is pass line. Making 95% as A, which is impossible. British accent, tone is so flat, make me sleepy within 5 mins after class starts
Very easy to understand and not a difficult class overall. However, he has a grading policy where if you fail one of his weekly 6 point quizzes you fail the class.
I loved his accent, british profs are sweet. I think he is just too smart. The average student has trouble following him sometimes. He was helpful and a fair professor. Definitely a good guy.

Took Algorithms in the summer w/ Carl when it had a 3 hour lecture; I stopped absorbing any info. about halfway through, so his lectures didn't do much for me. Homework was tough but fair, the final was reasonable. Going to take Adv. Algorithms with him.
The lectures were very hard to pay attention to. I can tell Keefe is an expert in his field, but he would spend large chunks of class talking about things we wouldn't be tested on. Projects were interesting and not too challenging, and Keefe was very willing to stay after class or spend class time helping out with them.
He is okay. I find him hard to understand sometimes because he speaks a bit fast for some reason and shakes his head.
Kauffman is a great lecturer, doesn't have the best personality tho. Lectures are clear enough for you to understand material the first time. Projects will suck up majority of your time but they're good prep for exams. provides lots of resources n extra credit opportunities if ur confident enough to speak in lecture.
At first, I was very excited to take this class, as I had only heard great things about Kauffman. However, he kinda fell apart this semester. There were only 2 projects instead of the promised 3, he stopped releasing homework/lab solutions, and he didnt post tests for the 2nd project until the day before it was due!
Honestly think Kauffman gets an undeserved god-like rep on here. He's definitely a nice guy but as a prof he goes so fast and there's too much work in the class. Projects, tests, labs, and engagement points are a lot to manage all at once esp online and it's easy to get so bogged down finishing everything that you don't do well on anything.
Everybody loves Kauffman, but for me he was just average. He called on random people in front of the whole class and asked follow up questions that you might not know the answer to, so I felt kinda stupid. fair projects and tests. lots of ways to get completion points. idk he just didn't live up to the hype, but he's still better than other profs.
Don't get the textbook, absolute waste of money. Lectures are very useful and valuable so make sure you actually show up for them. Projects 1 and 3 are ridiculously long so make sure you start early. Exams are open note and you can expect a couple of questions to be based on the projects.
Prof Chiang was a good instructor and the course had reasonable expectations. He gave practice exams that helped prepare you for the actual exam. But he's not super understanding, especially regarding mental health, so get a note or register with the DRC if you think you'll need accommodations (even if it's just for extensions or a makeup quiz)
Quiz every week, on lecture and textbook materials. Prof is not accessible outside of class. Have to go to TAs, only some of them are helpful. HWs are HARD but applicable to what we learn. Get ready to read and spend hours on HWs. He doesn't make the slides so sometimes it seems like he doesn't know what he's talking about. Helpful examples though.
He goes on wacky tangents and I kinda struggle to pay attention a lot of the time because I already know a lot of the stuff he is teaching. He's alright, just really not for me
No slides, but awful handwriting notes were provided. Just reading textbooks.
Very helpful TA. He even gave us extra time during the exam.
He is a caring person, however, the class is generally unorganized. The class webpage is somewhat cluttered. Assignments and exams are lengthy to a fault.
Projects are given a ton of time and you should visit office hours for them. Lack of homework/quizzes to understand some of the topics especially later into the course with the finals. DOES NOT CURVE so make sure to get all possible points in labs and projects. Practice midterms has no answer key. Manually draws out lectures so make sure to go.
This guy's lectures are pretty dry, but it's nothing that isn't doable with the textbook. Office hours are very helpful with this class so go early and often. There's a considerable difficulty spike in the second half of the semester so don't become complacent with this course. Fantastic guy, really cares about his students. Projects are massive.
CSCI3061 - Really nice guy that cares about what he's teaching. Lectures had no virtual option which made attendance essentially mandatory, but the content was taught well in them. Midterms were challenging, but the TAs and Prof. Dovolis were understanding and offered points back on various assignments. Would recommend.
Although there are aspects about Dovolis which were a little annoying (such as not posting notes online), he is making an effort to improve this course. Projects could be long but were never impossible and exams never felt too difficult as long as you studied well and took your time. Extra credit is weird with Dovolis, but it definitely helped.
Only posts lectures if he misses lecture. Checks attendance randomly and not during the same weeks. Few notes online. Handwrites code during lecture. Will sometimes give solutions to projects/labs during lecture. Grades are updated on Canvas at the discretion of his TA who will do it maybe once. Midterms are a bit difficult but fine with studying .
If you stay up to date on what's going on and how to approach what he's talking about, you'll be fine. If not (like me) make sure you do that whether it's going to office hours or watching videos on youtube.
He isn't the best professor, but he's also not the worst. It would be better if he used lecture slides, also on some more strange topics his lectures get sorta hard to follow. He explains in sort of a circular way where you won't know the foundations of something, but he'll teach you some weird property of it before the basics.
Prof. Dovolis is just below average. Projects are challenging, but doable. Labs are a lot of weekly work, but helpful. Test's are hard, but straightfoward. Only real issue is the absence of lecture notes, which would make him a solid prof.
If you want to do extremely hard projects and watch very boring lectures, then take him. However, his class is great for students who are looking for a job in computer science since his class prepares you well for technical interviews. The exams are hard and you get 1.5 hours to complete.
While dovolis didnt really teach all that much, most of the topics are easily found online. The exams are for the most part like the practice or sample exams and are worth a lot (20% each) So make sure to do well on them. Projects take a pretty long time, so make sure to start them early. Class wasnt too bad, should be an easy pass
He responds to email very quickly, which is nice. Clearly passionate about CS but not a great lecturer. Writes down too much code!! Everyone complains about the projects but theyre not that bad. Just get started early and youll be fine, you get two weeks to complete them and you can ask TAs questions if you get stuck.
I was annoyed by how he pushed all responsibility onto an army of TAs, and the tests were often oddly worded. The lectures and readings are fine, but the labs and projects are where you really learn. I ended up skipping a fair few readings and ended out fine. Projects are designed to be done as a group, making individual attempts much much harder.
Dovolis is a cool prof, and his lectures were clear and easy for me. The main issue is the exams and projects. Even though I was fluent in the material, the projects took a ton of time, and the exams were too hard. Like they were designed to make you lose points for no reason.
Lectures are okay. He does a decent job with explaining things, it's just presented a little messy sometimes. Exams are 60% of your grade and I found that to be kind of weird as it doesn't involve much coding. There are a few projects done throughout the course that you can do with a partner, if you do it by yourself it's definitely a lot of work.
The grading in this class made absolutely no sense. Tests are worth 60% of your grade and projects are only worth 25% when you spend most of the time in the class working on projects. Dovolis is an incredibly mediocre lecturer and does most of his work writing on a piece of paper. Overall the class was fine but it could be annoying at times.
This class was annoying. Large lecture where all graded aspects of the course are done by TAs. Very poorly written project and lab write-ups that faculty. Totally off-base expectations of the time you will spend on projects and labs. You will need to ask questions to understand what is expected of you, but will not always get an answer.
While Chris is clearly passionate about his students, his ability to teach clearly and concisely greatly detracted from that fact. He rambles about material not on the exams and I didn't truly learn any material until I looked online. This class is poorly structured, but you might have an easier time if you have a lot of previous Java/coding exp.
Chris gets a bad rap. His lectures are clear. GO TO LECTURE. His tests are a regurgitation of the lecture. He does have some quirks that he empties in lectures, as does every professor. If you start the labs and projects early the class is very manageable. If you don't understand a topic, ask for help b/c things build on each other very quickly.
Took 1933 during the fall. Bombed the first exam cuz I didnt know time complexity but came back swinging. Really time complexity is big in that class. Exams are 70% of the grade, and five projects worth 20% all together. Went to only five lectures total, u can learn urself tbh. Exams are weirdly worded and projects r way too much time.
Overall, he's a fine teacher. He is a pretty entertaining lecturer, but what is on the test does not really match what he would stress in class. I think he thinks he talks about topics a lot, so he puts them on the exam, when in reality he barely talked about them. Study the topics sheets! and go on the internet to get a more in depth knowledge
Okay I tell you what - when it comes to 2021, Dovolis isn't the worst choice by far. Given how ridiculously hard the course is, he is doing an okay job. His lectures are useless but the overall work load is also less when compared to other teachers. And he is very lenient when it comes to the final grade for the class. So,it is okay to take him.
Professor Dovolis is a very likable person and teacher. He usually started off class by asking for feedback on recent labs or tests. However, even though he connected well with the students, he lacked in a few areas. His tests were hard, long, and worded poorly. A lot of the grade was based on these tests and this caused a lot of stress overall.
Dovolis gets a lot of hate, but this class wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be. He has some good TAs and clearly cares a lot about this class. However, this class is really disorganized. Due dates and midterm dates shifted, he was unable to cover all the material in time. The class is midterm heavy and there are trick questions.
I had Dovolis for both 1933H and 2021, and he is definitely a professor that makes you work for your grade. 100% you need to read the textbook on your own time (and make sure you understand it) if you want to pass his tests, as he tends to include material not discussed in lecture. He is a really nice guy though and cares about his students.
Quizzes were pretty randomly timed. He would vaguely say when they wold be, and he managed to go off topic quite often in class. The TA's chosen were pretty awful as well, but Chris was okay, if he could stay on topic.
A lot of students got screwed, because he was a tough grader. He is a great teacher though. The projects and the labs are very straightforward, but the exams are just too hard! They have the most conceptual questions with really tough grading criteria. I would not recommend him, but it is not the end of the world if he is the only option you've got
Have to claim that 2021 itself is a tough class! You have to learn by yourself at some points and couldn't just wait for the professor to teach you. Chris tries to make the class exciting and he is patient to explain student's questions. If you are not sure if you can do good on the exams, try your best to get as much as points in HWs!
Overall decent, but not great. The class itself is very hard and Dovolis does his best, but lacks in certain areas. Lectures can be very boring and tough to get through because of the material. Be prepared to be confused when reading through the book and to struggle on projects and homework. He has pop quizzes as well.
Make time for this class! Tests are worth most of your grade so it's important to study for them, but even if you study there will still probably be a question you weren't expecting. His tests didn't always seem reflective of what we covered in lecture. Find a partner for labs and projects especially because that made the class a lot more doable.
Tough grader, tests on subjects that were briefly mentioned during class or not mentioned at all. About half of my class did not pass this course. Seems like a nice guy though.
I've had Dovolis twice now, and here's my conclusions about him: PROS: Fun lecturer, very nice guy, you'll learn a lot. CONS: Expects you to know everything, and know it well (I don't usually read textbooks but 2021 you have to). Tests are weird - you can study for days & there'll probably be questions that you don't even know what he's asking.
Chris is a nice and funny guy. However, given the difficulty of the class, his lectures are useless. Yet he gave pop quizzes so you have to be there. The management is pretty bad, schedule was changed frequently. In the end, for the sake of finishing his schedule, he rushed through 2 chapters, which made our life more difficult.
Many people that took 1933 this semester had very sour opinions of Dovolis. I came in with no Java experience and I did fairly well. You MUST pay attention during lecture. You will crash and burn if you do not ask questions to both Dovolis and the TAs. Some TAs were better than others. You probably won't get an A unless you already know Java.
His lecture is not organized, and he was really behind planned schedule towards the end of semester. Rushing was brutal that you would be tested without good preparation. His tests/quizzes are very confusing and tricky. In order to do well, you have to read the textbook. He tests you on some materials from book not in lecture.
He's really a fantastic lecturer, and I enjoyed that. His exams, however, are brutal, and designed to trip you up with minute details and things you're expected to remember from a 5 minute tangent in lecture 3 weeks before the exam. The projects aren't that difficult, and neither are the labs, but the exams make up most of your grade.
Dovolis himself was a good lecturer, and he had great information to share about practical applications of CS rather than just strictly book material. His TAsclass organization, however, were not so great. There was a ton of confusion over assignment expectations, and exams were graded much differently depending on the TA grading them.
We were constantly behind in lecture, to make up for it he would fly through material. Labs were pretty difficult. But if you put the time and effort into the class you should end up with a decent grade.
Homework is either too easy or ridiculously difficult. The labs are stupidly time consuming. He teaches a lot more theory in lecture vs. practical examples. The class moves at a good pace. DO THE LABS YOURSELF otherwise you will fail. I don't care if your partner is a genius - do them. Or else exams will make you cry.
Only somebody who does not focus on learning things will like Chris. He is nice but a terrible teacher, only talk about 1+1 = 2 in class but you will have calculus in lab and HW. He always left hard part to TA and lab, himself only talks about easiest thing and does not help overal. Grading system is ridiculous and you always see something in lectu
Dovolis is a great teacher; this class is introductory but has a wide range of students, and he makes it interesting for students of all programming backgrounds. Definitely recommend him!
Fairly good professor. Sometimes likes to go off on random tangents. He sorta goes really in depth on really simple concepts, but also on really difficult ones as well. So you will get the information you need, while being bored sometimes as well. However, if struggling in the class his response was "write more code", and nothing else.
Really knows his programming stuff, but is probably not a Windows user which shows during examples. Gives lots of examples that are only good for showing how commands are used. Pretty friendly and sort of funny. Taking 1902 with him next semester.
Eh, thought the class was pretty boring. Too many examples tend to rot my brain.
I've had Dovolis twice he's a nice guy. Not a genuis thats for sure. His coding examples are garbage and he can barely log into windows 2000, much less use internet explorer.
I thought he was a pretty good teacher. The class itself blew, but he made it mildley interesting.
Shana is one of the easiest graders I have ever had, but at the same time I felt like I learned barely anything and all the assignments especially the in-class assignments felt very tedious. If you want an easy A, take this class, but if you want an interesting, enjoyable class, do not.
Shana fluctuates between her kind persona and her angry post-military persona so frequently that you will get whiplash. The class wasn't much work outside of time spent on projects, which was mostly easy and enjoyable. Every assignment is graded with the lightness of a feather, and a student could submit a blank page and still probably pass.
Expect your questions to turn into long rambling side remarks. Other than that, the class is an easy A with multiple group projects and homeworks with incredibly lenient grading. Shana is also very welcome to feedback, but can be callous when asking questions where she expects you to already know the answer.
She was very lenient with grading at the beginning of the semester. Towards the middle of the semester, the grading became very strict. She honestly tries her best to be nice but most of the time she comes of very blunt. The content was delivered in a very straightforward manner. Don't be scared of her bluntness! You'll get used to it.
I can't say I learned a lot about databases in this class, but it was the easiest A I've ever received in a CSCI class, so if you're looking for an A I highly recommend Shana. Quizzes are easy (you get a cheat sheet) and assignments are graded super lightly.
Can't blame her, but the difficulty in grading between TAs was insane. I was teaching a friend how to do his homework and my TA was giving be 75s while my friend got 90s. Also clear that Shana comes from a small school. She needs to learn how to handle a larger class properly and be more considerate of it.
She's caring and good at showing it. Not really as good of a lecturer as what she often endorses herself to be from her years of teaching. Talks fast and rarely uses the board, making it hard to take notes. Complains about personal matters at times. Old adage is true that learning to code comes through practice. Do the homework and labs instead.
Shana was an okay teacher in a terrible class. I neglected other classes to finish the main project and wasn't able to even come close. She expected us to get done an insane amount of work, yet gets frustrated with people when they ask for grades or other questions. She interrupts people asking questions a lot and gets overwhelmed during class.
Course was mostly asynchronous with a weekly synchronous meeting. The professor seemed to really care about the students and was really excited to teach the course. The course was a little disorganized in the second half of the semester but manageable overall. If you put in a little effort, it's an easy A and a pretty fun course.
Note: A lot of complaints here are based nearly entirely on grade anxiety over one project that he ended up making optional. Realistically, he's a nice guy. Lectures could have used "easier" examples; a lot of things would not have been an issue if he gave clearer examples that started from an easier place before going into more complex examples.
Pros: midterms are incredibly similar to the mock midterms, final project was made optional bc it was so chaotic and not even TAs knew how to approach it. He's nice and accommodating to student feedback (especially when a majority of the students voice their struggles) Cons: Fast-paced lectures, reads off of slides, homework can ask a lot from you
He's a nice guy and accommodating to students. He's open to feedback, but 2041 was needlessly hard. Lectures weren't the best. The homework is doable, but they're harder than the easy midterms. The final project was confusing and difficult for everyone, including Joosten himself and the TAs. He ended up cancelling it to lessen everyone's stress.
Accommodated student's concerns, dropped final project, midterms similar to mock midterms, caring, kind, answer emails quickly, overall very sweet professor. Weekly homework are more difficult/challenging side, attendance mandatory, weekly check-off labs, free online textbooks. Lecture slides are provided along with clear lectures.
Professor Joosten is very nice, however, his teaching style is one that I had a hard time understanding. His lectures were required and could be confusing at times. He does go out of his way to try and help his students which I was very grateful for. Overall, he is a very kind, helpful professor, but his teaching style could be ambiguous.
The lectures were sometimes hard to follow, but he very clearly explains projects, and what will be on the exams.
Sebastiaan is one of the most interesting professors I have had at the U. His 2041 course has been far better than 2011 but there are still issues. His transition to online book lectures was really good, but his labs are confusing, especially the final project. Sebastiaan is always willing to adapt, so if you do have him, please voice any concerns.
Lectures are confusing, but he is very forgiving and really wants his students to do well. The tests are almost identical to the practice tests which helps with studying, and when we all failed a test he took responsibility and added a curve to the class. He provides lecture videos but it may be more helpful to use the textbook and slides.
The first half of the course was a disaster. Dense, long lectures and difficult exams, and discussion sections were ill-equipped for the confusion. But Sebastiaan took input, introducing a study guide for the 2nd exam and curving it due to its difficulty. He's a cool guy, and I think his classes will improve. Still, I've stopped attending lecture.
Sebastiaan is not a bad professor, people are just wayyy too soft. Discrete mathematics as a whole is a tough class to teach and is very theory based so your textbook and Youtube will likely be your best friend in this class. As a whole, Sebastiaan is a compassionate guy and although his lectures are dry, the practice tests are a godsend for tests.
Seeing all the hate towards Prof. Joosten makes me feel so bad for him because I feel like he genuinely cares ab his students and tries to cater his lectures towards the students requests. He is super smart but over complicates some topics, which can easily be solved by reading the textbook. The actual material of the class isnt hard at all.
The lectures are dry and not very helpful, which means you'll be doing a bit of reading outside of class. However, the course material isn't entirely difficult, and the practice exam looked nearly identical to the first midterm. Beware of a lack of a curve on exams.
Tim is actually a really nice and understanding person IF you go to his office hours. When I first started this class I was unfamiliar w coding and felt intimidated by the content, but once I went to office hours I felt pretty supported by him and the TAs
Good professor, Material is available via his powerpoint slides, he expects you to study and practice how to use the material. Homework is difficult but after trying different approaches you should be able to easily do them. Hardest part of class was exams on paper. you have to look closely to make sure everything is correct or will miss points.
If you know how to program already he is fine. If not, you need to pay attention. His lectures are alright once you get over the mannerisms. No curve, which can be an issue, but no final and there was an extra credit quiz to boost your grade. You learn best with the hands on labs. Exams are on paper and a bit dumb, but only 47% of the class.
He cares a lot about teaching but often falls a little bit short trying to explain these early computer science concepts. He is so good at it himself that he doesn't understand the position of the student who doesn't know a thing so often things might go over your head. I could do fine in this class because I took AP Comp sci in High School.
The class wasnt too bad. I was able to put in an average amount of work and come out with an A which clearly shows that he isnt the worst professor in the world. However, the class framework was moderately disorganized which makes it easy to not like the guy. If you can get past this it may end up being your favorite class of the semester.
Knows his stuff, but connects all of his ideas/statements with "at this point" and "therefore" ...
He wasn't the worst professor, but the lectures were often not super useful and there was a mandatory weekly discussion that was entirely group work. I stopped going to the lectures about halfway through the semester because they didn't seem like a good use of time compared to just reading the book.
Professor Larson definitely cares about here students, but the course material seemed rough, like it hadn't been used before. The class is project-based, so your grade is determined by how you do on this haphazard project. That said, Professor Larson is always willing to help, and if you put in the time this class isn't too hard.
Amy cares about her students and wants them to learn. However, her poor organizational skills hindering this seemed to be a common theme during the semester. She changed the weight of assignments throughout the semester, and again the day of the final. Within four days we had: a final project(code & paper), final test, and a homework assignment.
Attendance isn't mandatory, but there are no notes/slides online, so definitely go to lecture. Grading criteria on programming projects isn't very specific, but clear enough. The textbook is barely used. Very helpful during office hours. Overall Dr. Larson is a good professor.
dece
I took her Real Time Embedded Systems offered in Spring 2016. Amy is a sweet and approachable professor. Her classes were equal parts fun and boring. The homeworks were pretty programming intensive. The group project was fun and she let us choose our choice of projects. The course is amazing and recommend EE and CSci majors to take it.
Class was not too difficult for the most part. Homeworks were 60% of the grade and usually had pretty tricky problems that required some time to think about. Weekly quizzes were also a challenge. Tests were less difficult. This is not a coding class - it's more comparable to 2011 than any of the other required courses.
I'm not a fan of the way she taught this class. The lectures were straight out of the book and were often much more incoherent than the way the book presents the material, so it didn't always feel worthwhile. Homeworks are straight out of the book and fairly difficult as well. Weekly quizzes are annoying as well.
Her lectures at times were somewhat unclear, but that is definitely a result of the material's difficulty. At first her grading system (A >= 95%) seems ridiculous, but with diligent work it is very attainable. Tests seem hard, but are graded leniently and homeworks require dedication, but that's to be expected given it's a CSCI course. Good prof.
Amy makes an honest effort to bring difficult concepts to students, is patient with all levels of learners, and is clearly interested in her material. Her class left me wanting for heuristic explanations of algorithms rather than mechanical examples.
Kate's lectures are kind of fast-paced and she expects a lot from you. Homeworks are a lot of work and midterms can be difficult, a significant amount of your grade is on midterms and the final. Overall, she can explain stuff well but it's a lot of work.
Kate is a good teacher that explains things in a good amount of detail during lectures. There are no slides and no posts on canvas for notes, so if you don't go to class have fun reading 20 pages of the textbook. The course is content heavy and feels like we never truly master a topic before moving on. This class feels harder than it should be tbh.
If "just try harder" was a professor it would be Kate. I would recommend taking this difficult class with a professor that gives more material to learn from, as the textbook does the heavy lifting here. Overall just decent at best.
Kate Jensen is a middle of the road professor in my book. There were a lot of downsides: lack of availability, lectures over a year old, and a complete ban on working with other people. This said, if you are going to take the course, she is not a bad option. Homework and midterms are fair and match what is expected for the credit load.
Lectures were clear and the midterm was fine. I didn't love the textbook, as the answers in the back of the book often didn't show complete answers. Homeworks were graded harshly and were 55% of the grade. Professor was hard to contact and all lectures were recorded in Fall 2020. Didn't really seem like she put much effort into teaching the class.
Kate is really nice and caring about students and her lectures are very well explained and helpful. She also walks through practice problems in additional lectures. The weekly homework and quizzes are quite difficult and require close reading. Doing practice problems is super helpful and will allow you to be successful.
For context, I took this fall 2020 when it was online. I think they are a great lecturer and Im sure shes even better in person. Some quiz questions were quite unfair and her response to concerns were a bit frustrating. Grading for weekly HW was so nit picky as well. However, shes not as bad as every made her out to be on Reddit.
Took her class spring 2020, lectures were fine. We had weekly quizzes during in person, switched to homework assignments instead for online learning and we got to drop 2 quizzes/assignments. Discussions took attendance, midterms and final were alright.
Kate is a gifted lecturer, but she makes CSCI 2011 really hard. She loves throwing problems at you that are nothing like anything you have seen before, so if you don't have an intuitive understanding of all of the concepts you will struggle. People say CSCI 2011 is supposed to be easy but with Kate it can get very difficult.
Kate Jensen, at least as of now, teaches only 2011 and 4041, and I think has a lesser rating here only since many CS students aren't a fan of the less programming-heavy courses. She teaches the subjects very clearly, but they are quite difficult to understand fully without extensive studying outside of class. I got a B with a lot of effort.
She reads the book in lecture. if you can teach yourself, just read the book, saves time, there's more detail. Weekly quizzes are close to the homework, and she has longer "projects" that are (sometimes) difficult proofs. If you take this course with other profs, you don't have the projects, but the quizzes will be harder. Projects can boost grade.
Jensen is a good lecturer and explains basic concepts very clearly. As long as you do the recommended problems and pay attention to lecture you should do well on the weekly quizzes. However, her take home exams are ridiculously difficult and will require using material she didn't cover in class. The final is easy and open book.
She seems to explain concepts well, however, it may be difficult to grasp with no prior programming experience. 2.5 hour night lectures where often tough to get through but she keeps the class engaging enough to keep it from dragging. The in class quizzes are doable as long as you keep up with the exercises posted on the course page.
Jensen is knowledgeable but explains concepts in a high-level way when most of us are beginners. If you ask her to clarify she will just repeat herself over and over. Her lectures are hit or miss, some days I left feeling good but others I left more confused. Our class's midterm average was below Dovolis's because she added extra questions.
A solid professor for lectures and explaining concepts, but gives out lots of work. With long homework's, nearly weekly Zybooks, weekly in-class exercises, quizzes, and a final project that was due during finals week, the time needed for this class added up quick. However, I did learn a lot and Kluver does a great job at explaining concepts.
Pros: (Breaks concepts down well in lectures / Easy A if you put in the work / Caring / Nice guy / I learned a lot), Cons: (Labs were often tedious and useless / Extreme amount of homework assigned in first couple weeks / Programming tips were often not practical / Very nitpicky on random things / Unclear instructions on homework)
Challou doesn't really do much in lectures. He just reads off slides and makes you do participation exercises. The TAs, on the other hand, absolutely carry this class. The exams are HEAVILY weighted and can make or break your grade, meanwhile the homeworks (there were 7) are worth basically nothing but are a ton of work.
I did not learn anything from the lectures and there was a lot of busywork in this class. However, the homework assignment, although sometimes time-consuming have clear instructions and rubrics which is really nice and the tests were pretty reasonable. I learned a lot of practical, applicable skills in this class so definitely 100% worth taking.
For those who don't have experience in web development, this will be a super challenge in the first 3 hws. His hws are hard and time-consuming, along with that, the office hour isn't flexible, so you on your own. But things got better as we move on to further hws. He provides some backup information that will help you on these hws.
Dr. Challou is kind of a goof and is light hearted during class. He was flexible for me and often responds to questions in class quickly, though office hours are a mess. Not much material is learned in lecture, but that's okay because the homework cover content well. This class is basically just 7 homeworks and 1 or 2 of those are a lot of work
Professor Challou spends much of the class time going over examples of how to do problems similar to the homework assignments. If you are a reasonably confident programmer, you can do just fine by going through W3 schools to learn all of the material; lecture examples are unnecessary as homeworks are simple. W3 schools effectively replaces textbook
Dan won't hold your hand through projects and that's why I think people don't really like him. The course focuses a lot on program design that can be ambiguous (which he points out is what is going to happen in industry). Nonetheless, not too challenging if you read the textbook and design docs carefully, very informative course.
Dan enjoys wasting time doing necessary things like write 2-3 pages of code on the whiteboard. The worst thing is that sometimes he doesn't even post the code on moodle so if you didn't write it down then too bad. The class itself is useful if you don't have much internet prog experience and I learned more from w3schools and the textbook than Dan.
Dan was an adequate lecturer, but his flaws layed in his homework and test writing skills. Whether or not you had programming experience or not, it came down to whether you could understand what the test questions were asking. There were 4 tests total, 1&2 averaged low 60s and the other two mid 70s. Depended if he wanted to be a shmuck or not.
Chalou was a very interesting fellow to learn 1133 from. If anything, he does a fine job in lecture and stuff, but hes not the best and writing tests. We had 4 total tests, first two had averages in the 60s and the second two were in the 80s. It wasn't how prepared we were. It was whether he wanted to bone us or not. Overall, he's fine for 1133.
As others said, lecture duplicates the book and is generally boring, but if you pay attention he teaches well. Labs are mandatory and long, but important along with homework. Tests were reasonable but weighted heavily. Class would be better is the grading scale was more generous (94 for an A)
Class is way too easy/trivial to learn any actual web development. He practically gives away a majority of the homework solutions a day or two prior to the homework being due. You see others complaining because they've become to dependent on this instead of just thinking through the assignment. Exams are simple if you honestly do the hw.
Follows book quite closely, so if you do your readings the lectures become quite useless.
This class is mainly JavaScript/PHP/MySQL. I think exam is not effective to learn these things, but 50% of score is from exam. Also, grading is really strict. For example, there are 28 classes in this course, but if you skip 3 in class quizes, then you fail. Homework grading is also strict. I think this system is not so suitable to learn it.
2.5 hour lectures are enough to make any prof seem boring, so I can't really blame Prof. Challou if he seemed kinda dull at points. No quizzes so there are 4 assessments total in the class which is both intimidating and refreshing. Lab and HW are pretty fun if you like project based learning.
He stumbled through a few lectures but he was pretty decent overall. Great grad TA that was much more involved in the course than Prof. Challou. Tests often had questions on edge topics (e.g. set operations in Python). He honestly seemed like an earnestly great funny guy, just not quite comfortable with what the class (CSCI1133) was yet.
Very bright guy. Super nice and considerate. Gives good lectures. The requirements for assignments are clearly spelled out. There should probably be a little more communication between him and the TAs. I would take another class with him.
Lectures are not too important if you just read the textbook. Tests are pretty manageable -- we got to make a note sheet for all of them. Final was fairly straightforward. Definitely go to TA office hours for help on the tough homework.
He had a more relaxed nature when teaching that really worked in this class, fun and useful homeworks.
Pr. Zhao is by no means a bad professor. She is very timely in her grading, has a very accessible course format, and has super clear grading standards. However, some concepts were not covered in depth that later appeared on tests. Also, I came in knowing some (but not a lot) about Multivariable Calc, and got a bit overwhelmed by it.
